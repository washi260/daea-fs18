The mortuary site known as Naga ed-Deir is located east of the Nile and in Upper Egypt, near the city of Abydos. Its geographical as well as topographical context, situated near limestone cliffs, contributed to the site's use as a group of cemeteries which served the Abydos region for a near-continuous six thousand years. The uniformly detailed nature of burials at Naga ed-Deir allude to the care with which Ancient Egyptians treated their dead. When George Reisner led an archaeological expedition to Naga ed-Deir, he had the patience to appreciate those details as opposed to just finding the shiniest artifacts and shipping them off to museums. During his research lasting on and off from 1901 to 1924, Reisner and his team meticulously photographed and cataloged all artifacts and excavation sites. The grave goods they discovered helped date each tomb and even provided evidence of Egyptian-Mesopotamian contact in the Early Dynastic Period. In short, Naga ed-Deir has supplied the archaeological community not only with a wealth of artifacts but also with a great deal of perspective.

      <p>The Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter is located south of the Belizean capital of Belompan in the Caves Branch River Valley.  Near other rockshelters within the limestone cliffs that lie within the river valley, but far from any major ancient Maya political entity, this rockshelter was most likely used by the rural agrarian communities that utilized the river system for their crops.  Modern agriculture has greatly disturbed or destroyed many small and ancient farming communities, so rockshelters such as Sac Uitzil Ba act as important conduits to understanding rural and agrarian life for the prehistoric Maya.</p>

      <p>Subterannean spaces were areas of great cultural importance within the ancient Maya cosmology, and still play roles in modern day rituals among Maya indigenous communities, though mostly through a combination of traditional and Catholic rituals and ideologies (known as religous syncretism).  Since the Yucatan Peninsula is largely comprised of limestone, caves and rockshelters are common throughout the Maya area.  The ancient Maya utilized these spaces to a great extent and left behind a rich archaeological record.  Though not technically subterannean in the same sense as a cave, rockshelters were still the locations of rituals, both funerary and non-funerary.  The word for cave in some Mayan languages (<em>ch'en, ch'ee'n,</em> or <em>k'ee'n</em> just to name a few) is interpreted more as a subterannean space, rather than strictly a dark zone cave (CITATIONS).  Rockshelters in the Caves Branch River Valley have thus far supported this trend.  Furthermore, investigations conducted by CBAS have revealed that if rockshelters also had a dark zone cave component, the rackshelter space is heavily used while the dark zone cave is rarely, if at all used (at least in a manner that leaves an archaeological footprint).  As a result, it appears that the rockshelters act as the liminal zone between our physical world and the ancient Maya underworld, <em>Xibalba</em>; that the space between realms is as ritually significant, if not more in some cases, than the actual other supernatural realm.</p>

      <p>Since our realm was seen as the present and physical world with subterannean spaces being a part of the supernatural realm of the underworld in ancient Maya cosmology, mountains were sometimes characterized as a <em>Uitz</em> (earth) monster, as being a manifestation of the earth that 'swallows' individuals after they have left the realm of the living.  Caves acted as the maw of this <em>uitz</em> monster, such that stalactites hanging from the ceilings of cave and rockshelter entrances could be interpreted as the teeth othe the monster.  Such is the case with Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter; from the inside, a small shelf near the back of the rockshelter hangs down with stalactite formations.  This must have been a powerful metaphor for the ancient Maya living in the area.  The fang-like formations of the stalactites create the maw of the <em>uitz</em> monster with a dark zone cave directly behind it.  This may have been one of the reasons this space was chosen as a site of cultural and ritual use in anitquity.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the presence of primary burials within Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter indicates that this space had some sort of mortuary component, not only just non-funerary rituals.  Based on the presence of mostly primary burials (modern looting has somewhat obscured this), it is likely that SUB functioned primarily as a genetically kin-based ossuary in a ritually and culturally charged space, intended to lay some sort of claim to the physical world while simultaneously utilizing the subterannean aspect of the landscape as a threshhold to the underworld.</p>

     <h3>Discovery</h3>

       <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Map of the CBAS research area. Original map drawn by Shawn Morton, modified by Jack A. Biggs. October 2018.">Image 2</a> - "Map of the CBAS research area with the locations of known archaeological sites.  Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter is located in the northeast corner of the research area, denoted by the red lettering."</figcaption>
     </figure>

     <p>The site of Sac Uitzil Ba was formally discovered by Central Belize Archaeological Survey (CBAS) senior staff member Jack A. Biggs during the summer of 2017.  Sac Uitzil Ba (meaning the white mountain gopher in the Mopan Mayan language) was found mostly by accident.  Excavations of the 2017 field season were originally set to take place at the nearby Sapodilla Rockshelter (see map).  While hiking back after excavating one day during the early field season, site co-directors Jack A. Biggs and Amy Michael took the Michigan State University field crew to go exploring in some known nearby caves.  While walking around the base of a limestone cliff near the caves, Biggs came across another small but deep rockshelter.  The rockshelter had undergone some looting activity as evidenced by fragmented human skeletal remains and potsherds scattered across the rockshelter floor. </p>

     <p>Brief documentation was conducted that first.  Excavations at Sapodilla Rockshelter had yielded little material as it had been extensively looted since the 2011 excavations that took place at the site.  Excavation units at Sapodilla were completed with the remainder of the field season focused on the newly discovered rockkshelter.</p>

     <p>During the first official day of excavations at Sac Uitzil Ba, a second and connecting chamber within the rockshelter was discovered.  Accessible from the first chamber of SUB via a small tunnel or over a large stone ledge high up the rockface, the second chamber is located higher above the ground surface than the main lower chamber.  Two other entrances were discvered to reach up to the second chamber from the jungle floor by hiking up a steep incline.  Due to the small nature of both these chambers, excavation operations were split in between the two chambers.  The first and lower chamber discovered was then termed the Main Chamber while the newer and higher chamber was named the Upper Chamber.</p>

     <p>The Upper Chamber connected only to the Main Chamber and to the outside jungle.  Small tunnels and niches inaccessible for humans exist and have not been explored.  However, the rear of the Main Chamber connects to a small and winding cave system.  Large rims from ancient Maya water jars were discovered in a far back chamber and down a wash and were calcified in place.  Other tunnels connect to ledges above the rockshelter's Main Chamber, though no cultural materials were found there.  Additionally, no other ecidence has been found of cultural materials within the caves themselves.  The floor of the caves is either flowstone or clay that most likely existed in antiquity and was not modified.</p>

     <h3>Early Excavations</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     <p>So far, excavations have been conducted at SUB for one field season, during the summer of 2017.  The remoteness of the site has no doubt contributed to it being overlooked.  Limestone cliffs are very common throughout the entire region with numerous rockshelters remaining undiscovered by archaeologists or researchers.</p>

     <p>Although small, SUB has already revealed a wealth of material from the excavations by CBAS.  Salvage operations were the initial focus of early excavations at the site.  The looting activities that led to the discovery of SUB displaced the skeletal remains of at least four individuals, likely from primary burials, as well as artifacts such as ceramic pots and potsherds, granite metate fragments, worked lithic material, and marine shell pieces.  Some of the skeletal remains were clustered and it was theorized that bone fragments and pieces located in near proximity to one another were likely from the same individual as looting activity was focused around pits that were separated and distinct from one another.</p>

     <p>After salvage operations were completed, areas of excavation within the two chambers of the rockshelter were identified.  Areas of untouched (unlooted) soil were chosen to discover any areas where artifacts and burials might be encountered that had not been disturbed by looting activity.</p>

     <p><h4><em>The Main Chamber</em></h4></p>

Biggs, June 2017.">Image 3</a> - "Photograph of small jadeite beads found around the chest and neck of an individual buried within the Main Chamber of the Sac Uitzil Ba Rockshelter. A total of five jadeite beads were found with this individual, likely from a necklace placed on the body before or during the funerary process."</figcaption>
     </figure>

     <p>Skeletal remains found in the Main (lower) Chamber were generally in a better state of preservation compared to those recovered in the Upper Chamber, however the variety of artifacts associated with burials was markedly less.  As will be discussed in further detail below, artifacts from the Upper Chamber but not found in the Main Chamber included whole monochrome ceramic vessels, a polychrome ceramic vessel, a metate fragment, and a greater abundance of worked lithic material.  In the Main Chamber, large potsherds belonging to water jars were found stacked on the surface of the rockshelter (placed there by looters) and small jadeite beads were found accompanying one individual in a primary burial (see Image 3), a phenomenon not seen in the Upper Chamber.</p>

     <p>Unfortunately, only one individual from the Main Chamber was found and excavated in its entirety, Burial 7.  Other burials that were identified within the Main Chamber come from looted contexts.  However, Burial 7 was incredibly well preserved and was found in a flexed position, laying on their right side with their head towards the northeast, in the direction of the entrance of the rockshelter.  This individual was buried with the small jadeite beads described earlier, as well as a cache of human teeth from an adolescent individual located around the head of Burial 7.  Tooth caches have been reported elswehere within the Maya area (Wrobel et al. 2017; more citations) and have been interpreted in a number of ways.  However, Biggs and Michael (2019 forthcoming) argue that caches such as these, containing small amounts of biological material, should be interpreted as form of paritibility, meaning that a piece can represent the whole.  Teeth are easily recognizeble in living humans and in skeletonized individuals.  The inclusion of these recognizable pieces can act as a form of social ties to other individuals, groups, or even geographic areas.  The Maya people who buried the individual from Burial 7 could have been using the teeth to ensure that the deceased individual had a stake in the afterlife as well as further staking their own claim to the sacred burial space occurring in the liminal zone between the outside living world and the dark cave of the underworld, <em>Xibalba</em>.</p>

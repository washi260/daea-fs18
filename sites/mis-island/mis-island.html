         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Located in the Fourth Cataract of the Nile River, the site of Mis Island was a part of Upper Nubia. Mis Island was a primary focus during a salvage archaeology effort that resulted in invaluable material and osteological recoveries. The Sudan Archaeological Research Society (SARS) initiated this large project on Mis Island, as well as on other sites along the Fourth Cataract, in response to the planned construction of the Merowe Dam. Archaeological finds indicate occupation at this site from the Kerma, Meroitic, and medieval time periods. However, given the rescue nature of the excavations at Mis Island, much of the work from this site concentrated on medieval Nubian artifacts and human remains.</p>

     <p>The ancient Nubian site of Mis Island was situated upstream of the Nile’s Fourth Cataract in modern day Sudan. Now inundated by the dam, the site lies under the Merowe Reservoir. Mis Island was less than 2km across east to west and approximately 1km north to south. Before being flooded, the islands in this stretch of the Nile were described as having a desert landscape at their centers with oasis-like vegetation closer to the river banks (Welsh, 2013). The river banks of these islands of the Fourth Cataract were high and rocky with narrow areas of fertile soil (Näser, 2007). The Nile Valley adjacent to Mis Island and its neighboring islands was closely bordered by desert (Welsh, 2013).</p>

 <h3>Description of the Site</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>While archaeological findings demonstrate that Mis Island was inhabited in the Kerma and Meroitic periods and through the medieval phases, the majority of work on the island of Mis concentrated on its medieval occupation dating from the mid-fifth to early fifteenth centuries AD (Ginns, 2006). Mis Island represented a small rural community situated in the territory of the medieval Nubian kingdom of Makuria (Welsby, 2002). The Fourth Cataract’s challenging accessibility and resulting isolation has been presented as an advantage for the region that provided refuge from political instability, although the continuous occupation of the numerous settlements in the area indicate the region’s steady use as a home (Hurst, 2013). Medieval settlement at Mis Island is observed by its primary sites of a late Christian church, a settlement, and several cemeteries. Also observed on Mis Island are Muslim burials associated with the end of the medieval period (Ginns, 2010a), a time involving political control from Muslim Egypt and conversion to Islam in Nubia (Soler, 2012). Remains from Muslim burials at Mis Island were not excavated to comply with religious observations (Soler, 2012). The Muslim cemetery remained in use by modern people until construction of the dam, demonstrating the continuous occupation of Mis Island (Ginns, 2010a).</p>

 </figure>

<p>Excavation of Mis Island, as well as multiple sites along the Fourth Cataract, began as part of a large salvage archaeological project in response to the planned construction of the Merowe Dam. In the 1980s, the Sudan government renewed interest in a project first proposed in 1942 to build a dam at this region of the Nile (Ahmed, 2014; Welsby, 2003). The National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums (NCAM) recognized that the engineering activities and concomitant flooding associated with this dam had the potential to affect numerous archaeological sites in the Fourth Cataract region (Ahmed, 2014). In response to the anticipated inundation of archaeological sites, the NCAM recruited several international archaeological groups to be involved in the Merowe Dam Archaeological Salvage Project (MDASP) before completion of the dam in 2009 (Ahmed, 2014; Welsby, 2003).</p>

<p>Mis Island resided within the concession headed by the Sudan Archaeological Research Society (SARS) which involved approximately 40km of the Nile’s left bank between Amri and Kirkbekan and the immediate islands (Ahmed, 2014; Welsby, 2006). The SARS concession was headed by Project Director Derek Welsby and the Field Director for the area including Mis Island was Andrew Ginns (Ahmed, 2014). First surveyed in 1999, a total of fifteen archaeological sites on Mis Island were identified, six of which were investigated further through excavations in the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 field seasons by SARS and the British Museum (Ginns 2007, 2006). The primary sites excavated are as follows: a Late Christian church and associated cemetery referred to as 3-J-18 near the center of the island; cemetery 3-J-10 located 300m north of the church; cemetery 3-J-11 at the northern border of the island; cemetery 3-J-20 at the highest elevation on the east side of Mis; medieval settlement 3-J-19 located 50m east of the church and north of cemetery 3-J-20; and Kerma cemetery 3-J-22 50m south of cemetery 3-J-11 (Ginns 2007, 2006).</p>

 <h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>The results from the excavations at these six sites contribute to the archaeology of rural medieval Nubia. From these excavations, archaeologists were able to gain insight into the settlement of this island and explore mortuary behavior. The mortuary customs observed in the medieval cemeteries reflect Christian ideological customs, as well as burial practices perhaps indicative of social standing within this community. A significant portion of the recovered material was human skeletons and naturally mummified remains (Welsby, 2007). The large skeletal sample excavated from three separate medieval cemeteries provide invaluable opportunities for osteological research on the settlements of Mis Island (Ginns, 2007). Also recovered from the island of Mis was a collection of Kerma and post-Meoritic pottery (Welsby, 2007).</p>

 <h4>Church and associated cemetery 3-J-18</h4>
 <p>The Late Christian church and its associated cemetery were positioned on a slight slope just east from the island’s center and bordered by bedrock outcrops (Ginns, 2010c, 2006). The remnant rubble of the church revealed three structural phases (Ginns, 2006). Accompanying the church as a functional unit were two burials consisting of the remains of two adult males interred within the church and with well-preserved textiles (Ginns, 2006). The location and quality of these burials may reflect the social status of these individuals, who were perhaps priests or patrons of the church (Ginns, 2006). Throughout the church and within various stratigraphic layers of wind-blown silts were numerous ceramic vessels, some of which were imported and others that were more rudimentary local wares (Ginns, 2006). While their exact purpose is unclear, the intentional placement and subsequent respect for them was interpreted as ritual behavior following the church’s functional tenure (Ginns, 2006).</p>

 <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Monuments at Cemetery 3-J-18. Ginns (2010c), accessed 8 November 2018.">Image 4</a> - "Monuments at Cemetery 3-J-18"</figcaption>

 </figure>

 <p>The cemetery associated with the church represented three phases of burials—the first predating the church, the second contemporaneous with the church, and the last overlaying the earlier burials likely following the church’s collapse (Ginns 2010c). There were three or four graves from the first phase that lay under the church and were aligned northwest-south, as opposed to the later graves in the cemetery that were interred in a more east-west orientation (Ginns, 2010c). Phase two burials represented the majority of the cemetery with 173 burials, which were marked with various monument types (Ginns, 2010c). The final phase consisted of 42 burials marked by stone monuments and situated in the northern section of the cemetery (Ginns, 2010c). A total of 217 complete individuals were excavated from cemetery and church 3-J-18 (Ginns, 2010c).</p>
 <p>The demographic profile of the individuals interred in this cemetery revealed a substantially low number of infants, under the expected infant mortality rate (Ginns, 2007). This pattern may signify a preference for burying children in the 3-J-10 and/or 3-J-11 cemeteries, suggesting that cemetery 3-J-18 was in use at the same time as the others and may have offered an option for where to be buried (Ginns, 2007). Additionally, this cemetery is distinguished in its connection to the church and better state of preservation (Ginns, 2007). These findings may indicate a degree of prestige associated with this cemetery and a choice location of burial for individuals with higher social standing (Ginns, 2007). Finally, there were no ceramic vessels found with the burials; however, there were multiple cases of jewelry found with individuals, two of which had metal cross pendants (Ginns, 2007).</p>


 <h4>Cemetery 3-J-10</h4>
 <figure style="float: right; width: 55%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

 <img src="img/cemetery3-j-10.png" width="100%" />

 <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Cemetery 3-J-10. Ginns (2010a), accessed 8 November 2018.">Image 5</a> - "Cemetery 3-J-10"</figcaption>

 </figure>

 <p>Cemetery 3-J-10 was situated 300m northwest from the church site 3-J-18 in an area of alluvial deposits and was surrounded by rock outcrops (Ginns, 2010a, 2006). This cemetery was potentially where the last Christian burials on Mis were interred and was in use between approximately AD 1100 and AD 1400, which includes the time period of Nubia converting to Islam (Ginns, 2006). On the southwest side of the cemetery, there is a “visible transition of belief” demonstrated by a shift in grave monument type with the early Muslim burials positioned near the Christian burials (Ginns, 2006:17). The eastern side of the medieval cemetery was bordered by a Muslim cemetery that was still in use during modern times (Ginns, 2010a).</p>
 <p>An estimated 262 box-grave monuments were believed to be present at this site and by the end of the excavations, a total of 126 individuals were recovered from across the cemetery (Ginns, 2010a). All of the burials were aligned east to west and there were two main burial styles observed in the cemetery—standard box-type monuments with or without rocks or mud-bricks covering the head (Ginns 2010a, 2007). While both types were seen for adults throughout the cemetery, a section in the eastern side of the cemetery contained a grouping of infant and child burials which did not have head covering structures (Ginns, 2010a). There was also variation among adults in body positioning; however, there was a higher proportion of prone burials in the subadult zone, as well as a reversal in orientation with the head towards the east end of the grave (Ginns, 2010a). This pattern suggests a purposeful mortuary behavior pertaining to these younger individuals (Ginns, 2010a).</p>

 <h4>Cemetery 3-J-11</h4>
 <p>Cemetery 3-J-11 was located near the northern edge of the island in a terrain of alluvial formation and pebble deposits from the river (Ginns 2010b). Representing the largest burial site on Mis Island, this cemetery spanned AD 300 – AD 1400 (Ginns, 2006; Soler, 2012). A total of 288 sets of remains were excavated from across cemetery 3-J-11 which was about half of the individuals likely interred at this site (Ginns, 2010b). The stone box-type monuments varied in size and style between graves and based on the variations in burial practices, this cemetery contained three primary phases (Ginns, 2010b, 2007, 2006). </p>
 <p>The first phase was represented by two later Kushite burials, which contained grave goods and were located in the southeastern part of the cemetery (Ginns, 2010b). Phase two consisted of roughly fourteen burials where the deceased had been laid on either their sides or backs into narrow grave cuts with flat slabs above to prevent backfill filling the space. The majority of these burials contained ceramic vessels, the inclusion of which was noted as a characteristic unique to cemetery 3-J-11 compared to the other cemeteries on Mis (Ginns, 2010b, 2007). The final phase was represented by graves that were further divided into three burial types based on body positioning and presence of mortuary structure (Ginns, 2010b). In most cases at cemetery 3-J-11, burials were oriented east to west to some varying degrees (Ginns, 2010b).</p>

 <h4>Settlement 3-J-19</h4>
 <p>About 50m east of the church, a medieval settlement was found occupying a space approximately 130x130m and surrounded by rock outcrops (Ginns, 2010d, 2006). Much of settlement 3-J-19 was bare when excavated, mostly consisting of scattered stones from collapsed buildings and Late Christian potsherds (Ginns, 2010d, 2006). Stone building foundations that were sub-circular and sub-square were studied; however, their state of disarray made interpreting specific functions difficult (Ginns, 2010d, 2007). The recovered ceramics were consistent with the settlement being synchronous with the church (Ginns, 2006). Additionally, this settlement contained remnants of structures perhaps related to livestock. During excavation, channels produced from small stakes next to one another were interpreted as indications of fences or semi-permanent walls maybe associated with animal husbandry (Ginns, 2010d, 2007). Also found in this surface were fourteen post-holes which may have belonged to posts supporting roofs over animal pens (Ginns, 2010d, 2007).</p>


 <h4>Cemetery 3-J-20</h4>
 <figure style="float: right; width: 31%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

 <img src="img/cemetery3-j-20.png" width="100%" />

 <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Cemetery 3-J-20. Ginns (2010e), accessed 8 November 2018.">Image 6</a> - "Cemetery 3-J-20"</figcaption>

 </figure>

<p>Located at the top of a hill on the east side of the island, cemetery 3-J-20 contained five medieval inhumations, all of which had been previously robbed (Ginns, 2010e, 2007). Four of these burials were associated with fired red-brick monuments, one of which was further enclosed by a stone structure not found on the rest of the island and posited as a mausoleum (Ginns, 2010e, 2007). Red-brick fragments, pottery sherds, and human bone fragments were recovered from inside the structure (Ginns, 2010e, 2007). The location of these burials at a high point on the island was an unexpected area for a cemetery, particularly given that forming the graves would have necessitated the relatively difficult task of cutting into bedrock compared to the soft silt/sand deposits of the other cemeteries at Mis (Ginns, 2007). This selected area for these burials may reflect a motive to give them a prominent and highly visible position. The exclusiveness and distinction of this cemetery, coupled with its associated monuments, suggest that this cemetery may have been intended for individuals or family group in the community with a higher social status (Ginns, 2010e, 2007).</p>



 <h4>Cemetery 3-J-22</h4>
 <p>At the base of rock outcrops just south of an alluvial basin, a cemetery dating to the Kerma period was found (Ginns, 2006). Cemetery 3-J-22 was represented by several ill-defined tumuli, which were too disturbed to allow for individual identification. Before excavating, fragments of Kerma potsherds and human bone were recovered from the surface. The southern third of the cemetery was excavated down to below the mounds, where there were no grave cuts observed in the alluvial layers underneath.</p>

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>Archaeological study of Mis Island, as well as other sites in the MDASP, provide important insight on life in rural ancient Nubia as much of the knowledge of these past populations had been excavated from more royal and elite urban centers (Ahmed, 2014). These investigations also contribute to understanding the relationship between Makuria and Egypt during the medieval phases which shifted between prosperous and aggressive (Welsby, 2002). In particular, Mis Island highlights the ideological and political interaction with Egypt in Makuria’s conversion to Christianity and subsequently to Islam following takeover from the north.</p>
 <p>The excavations at Mis Island have proven an invaluable investigation into this settlement and recovery of material from a site that is now inaccessible. The human osteological remains from cemeteries 3-J-10 and 3-J-11 are curated at Michigan State University and the those from cemetery 3-J-18 are housed at the British Museum. These large skeletal samples have provided opportunities for bioarchaeological inquiry of both Mis Island itself and more broadly, of medieval Nubia. Osteological data collected from Mis Island has been compared with analogous data from additional Nubian sites (e.g., medieval Kulubnarti) to gain a relative understanding of life at Mis Island, as well as a wider regional perspective of life in medieval Nubia (Hurst, 2013; Soler, 2012; Streetman, 2018; Vollner, 2016).</p>

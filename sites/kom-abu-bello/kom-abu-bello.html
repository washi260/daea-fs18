         <h3>Introduction</h3>

		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


		 <p>Kom Abu Bello is an ancient Egyptian site, also known as Mefket in ancient Egyptian Pharaonic times. Although there a very little remains including artifacts and tombs, and that a major part of this ancient city is now covered by the modern town of Tarana, Kom Abu Bello has played a significant role in the reconstruction of historical culture, religion, and social relations in ancient Egypt from circa 300 BC to AD 500. Especially during the period of conversion from the Pharaonic era into the Coptic era, where this site was also known as Terenuthis during the Graeco-Roman period, and later known as Terenouti during the Coptic era.</p>

     <h3>Region and Geography</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

    <p>Kom Abu Bello is a famous prehistoric site of Ancient Egypt. It is a small village located on the western edge of the Delta, marked in the modern town of Tarrana, north-west of the modern Egypt capital city, Cairo. The site runs along the Rosetta branch of the Nile river. This site remains on what is considered a forgotten route. This forgotten route is very crucial to unveiling Egyptian history. The location of the site played a key role in the discovery in excavating the complete layout of Kom Abu Bello. Since the site is designated beside a branch of the Nile from the south of the Mediterranean, the site had been a wind corridor where sand starts to change the landscape. The location of Kom Abu Bello is extremely important because it is a link between two very vast production of rich and highly valued minerals in the daily life of ancient Egyptians during the prehistoric Roman period.</p>

    <h3>Description of Site</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

  <p>The remains of this ancient archaeological site of Kom Abu Bello is remotely vague. Francis Llewellyn Griffith, an eminent British Egyptologist during the late 19th and early 20th century, first discovered an important fragment of this site. The temple of Hathor, also known as the “Mistress of Mefket” during the 1880s had been unveiled. The site was and still is incomplete. Evidence that still lies within the modern town of the ancient civilization is comprised of the pharaonic cemetery, parts of temples including the mudbrick walls and tombs, ceramic lamps and artifacts, and potsherds on the surface of the land especially in the area west of Tarana called Baltous. It has not yet been able to be fully excavated on the reconstruction of the temple. Only a small segment of the settlement of Terenuthis had been excavated.</p>

  <p>The remains and debris of settlement were discovered on the east side of the Canal of Nasser as well as the excavated and Middle Kingdom cemeteries from the southwest and the east. There are certain limestone fragments that were found buried beneath the surface located on the northern edge of the site which were found to be the only remains of the Apollo temple due to the temple being completely demolished. A major part of the ancient city is now covered by what is now the modern town of Tarana and the cultivation that lies west and south of the modern-day capital of Egypt, Cairo.</p>

  <p>The ancient archaeological site of Kom Abu Bello is alluded to the site were the Greco-Roman cemetery is found, which most likely had derived from the Greek Apollo who had a temple dedicated at the northern edge of the site. The first excavation of this site was discovered by F.L. Griffith in 1887 to 1888. Griffith had discovered and recorded the remains of the temple known as Per-Huthor-Nbt-Mefket, or the temple of Hathor, “Mistress of Mefket”. Since the excavation by F.L. Hathor, a segment of the site was later excavated by the University of Michigan led by E. Peterson, from 1969 to 1974 as a result from the construction of the Nasser Canal that had required the salvation of what had remained. Evidence of the remains dates back to the Middle Kingdom and the restoration of the temple led into the New Kingdom era from 1550 to 712 B.C. referring to the period of ancient Egyptian history between the 16th century BC and the 11th century BC. The temple of Hathor was dedicated to honor and worship one of Egypt’s loved goddess (who was known as the goddess of joy, feminine love, and motherhood). The temple complex is located southeast of the city of Dendera in upper Egypt. It had been constructed during the late Ptolemaic period, during the reign of Ptolemy. The Mistress of Mefket had been graphically depicted in the tomb as a symbol of a sistrum, also known as a musical instrument that was believed to have driven away evil spirits. The ruins of the temple had contained blocks of finely carved bas relief scenes depicting that it may have been built by Ptolemy I, the first Egyptian ruler during the Egyptian period and may have been finalized by Ptolemy II. A cattle cemetery was also discovered in the same area which had a connection to the worshipping of the goddess Hathor. This temple is one of the few existing and preserved tomb that has been dated back to the founder of the Greek Dynasty.</p>

  <p>The limestone founded on the site of Kom Abu Bello is of Ptolemy I dates back to 305-282 B.C, Egyptian Ptolemaic Dynasty, during the reign of Ptolemy I Soter. This slab shows Ptolemy I on the right, offering incense (a substance that is burned to illuminate a fragrance) to the Egyptian goddess Hathor. Along with the hieroglyph of the offering, the slab contained an incomplete inscription. The papyrus hieroglyph had been deciphered as ‘green’, regarding as a plant, and ‘great green’ another Egyptian term for the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

  <p>Along with this monumental temple, a substantial amount of other discoveries and artifacts were made during the construct of the Nassar canal between 1969 and 1974. Some artifacts include statues of Anubis, Isis, Taweret and Best included with hieroglyphic inscriptions, stone blocks engraved with the name of Ramses the II, and pottery lamps with illustration on it. There were numerous amounts of artifacts and jewelry that were included such as gold and silver earrings, bracelets, rings, amulets, pots and amphorae.</p>

  <p>A monumental cemetery was discovered in which it preserved numerous amounts of tombstones. The tombstones dated back to the Old Kingdom during the 6th Dynasty of 2345 BC. Some of the Philistine tombs that had been discovered were found with decorations and inscriptions and texts. One of the Philistine tombs that had remained had a stelae, which is a stone or a wooden slab that was constructed during the ancient Egyptian times, usually bearing inscriptions, reliefs, or paintings of some sort as a commemorative monument. The stelae were depicted as Atilon and his family dating back to the 3rd century AD. The illustration shows Atilon is lying on a couch, protected by the ancient Egyptian god Anubis, who is known to watch over the dead. There were also discoveries of certain truncated pyramid shaped graves dating back to the 4th century AD.</p>

  <p>Overall, the excavation of the large cemetery Kom Abu Bello contained numerous amounts of tombs dating back from the 6th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, to the 4th century C.E. during the Coptic period. The tombs were intellectually and sophisticatedly designed structures. Coffins dating back to the New Kingdom were often found with sophisticated designed Egyptian stela which were often deciphered and represented the one who’s placed inside with demotic and or Greek texts. In addition to these findings, constructed with fine craftsmanship and technique, ceramic lamps have been uncovered with designs of the goddess Mefkat, showing the importance of how religion had a significant impact on the daily life of Egyptian civilization. Other significant artifacts that have been discovered were numerous amounts of relics, gold, bracelets, necklaces, and amulets, along with painted pottery dating back from the end of the Pharaonic to the Coptic period.</P>

  <p>Now, after countless amount of years without any activities and excavations on the site of Kom Abu Bello, the site is now a long stretch of fertile fields with elevated level ground covered with dunes. There are still numerous amounts of mounds throughout the region and in the modern Egypt capital city, Cairo.</P>

  <h3>Results and Significance</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>The significance of the excavation and exploration of the ancient Egyptian site of Kom Abu Bello is highly valued. Although the majority of this ancient city is hidden, the discovery of what had been excavated has played a critical role in reconstructing the history, culture, religion, and social relations during the ancient Egyptian times especially with the transition from the Pharaonic times into the Coptic era. The discovery of this site has revealed the religious beliefs with the combination of both Egyptian and Greek traditions. Excavations of the temples and tombs with ancient Egyptian scriptures and hieroglyphic texts that unveils the daily life and traditions this civilization had followed, which has been illustrated through these archaeological finds. There were various amount of evidence showing that there had been connections of material trading tying in the connections of Greek-Roman era and the transfer of religious and cultural traditions into the ancient Egyptian period. Kom Abu Bello is extremely significant as it is one of the only sites that is able to illustrate the ancient Egyptian civilization during the period of conversion from the Pharaonic era into the Coptic era.</p>

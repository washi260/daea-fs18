     <p>The site of Gebel el-Silsila features the largest sandstone quarries in ancient Egypt. Gebel el-Silsila is famous for its many New Kingdom stelae, funerary shrines, and the rock-cut temple previously known as the Speos of Horemheb. A Swedish mission lead by Maria Nilsson and John ward has discovered 12 new tombs dating from the 18th Dynasty (Thutmosid period), including crypts cut into the rock, rock-cut tombs with one or two chambers, a tomb containing multiple animal burials, and several burials of children, some still intact.Except for the small excavations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries led by Legrain and Sayce the site never was properly excavated. It was then decided that the responsibility of excavating the site was given to Caminos under Egypts Exploration society. He then died before finishing and now the responsibility is given to the Gebel el-Silsila Project at Lund University, with Maria Nilsson leading. Because of this I am going to talk about recent studied done by Maria and her team because I couldn’t find resources for the earlier projects.  </p>

 <p>The site of Gebel el-Silsila is located on both sides of the Nile in between Edfu and Kom Ombo in the Aswan region. Located at the point where the Nile river reaches its lowest point. The site is now divided into east (Gebel el Silsila) and west (Ramadi Gibli) with ancient quarries that run for 2.5 and 5 km along the Nile respectively. During the New Kingdom, Gebel el-Silsila significance was the topographic features including the extremely narrow river bed surrounded by sandstone hills and they believe that it is a place of religious importance as a place of worship. It was also a place of royal favor towards individuals. This resulted in a substantial number of monuments, from temples to graffiti, most of them cut into the rock and is still there. <p>

    <h3>Site Description and Excavations</h3>

<p>The site was known to the ancients as Kheny, possibly “Rowing place”, or Pa mu wab, “The Pure Water”. Its Arabic name – Gebel el Silsila, “Mountain of the Chain” – is believed to derive from one of its ancient names Khol-khol, meaning “barrier” or “frontier”, and later transformed to Sil-sil by the Romans. Among 52 quarries located on the nile quarry 34 is by far the biggest. Along with that Archaeological, topographical and epigraphical material indicates not one, but two quarries during the Pre-roman period and the survey revealed that the two quarries were separated by a southern wall that was broken through during the time of Augustus or Tiberius.
Nilsson and her team focuses were on 34 because of its size and basically you have to start somewhere and there are no other findings on readings besides this teams research. They found archaeological material on the surface including pottery, charred coal, red bricks, and more. The material that was found on the top of the heaps suggests that they were used as shelters whether temporary or permanent. It showed that there was grass or reed that could have been used as bedding material. The concentration of pottery sherds on the hill and a preliminary analysis indicates that the shelters were in use contemporary to the quarrying which means during the early Roman period. The location of the huts was in direct connection with the quarry walls which suggested that they were there to keep the pain pathways free from falling debris. In one section they found burned red bricks, charred coal, large pieces of slag and clear flakes of iron suggesting that is was a blacksmiths workshop. Much of the graffiti at Gebel el-Silsila were produced by workmen, scribes, officials, expedition leaders or possibly priests. They had been assigned to extract stone for the construction or renovation of temples, shrines, pylons and gates in Upper Egypt. Some of the texts date to the earliest Imperial Period. By interpretation these text you can learn about their past and what life was like during their time.
As for the East bank there are several statues, some unfinished, in some of the quarries. Two Nilometers dating back to the Roman times. Which a Nilometer is a tool used to indicate the height reached by the Nile during its annual floods. To the north of the quarries are some remains of a temple dating to the reign of Ramesses II. There was also a cemetary but modern day grave robbers have taken some the finds, many of which seem to have been given to the Musée d’archéologie national in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
As for the West bank two temples sit there, both dating to the reign of Horemheb. The remains of one of them, at Nag el-Hammam were destroyed in the 1970’s by explosives.  On the back wall of the sanctuary, statues of the seven main cult recipients are cut out of the rock Amun-Ra occupies the center, flanked by Mut to his right and Khons to his left. Next to Mut are Taweret and Sobek. The kingis placed between Khons and Thoth. While  Taweret is not the central deity but, is singled out by the picture of a vulture suspended above her statue. There are some rock shrines there as well. There are many statues, shrines, and temples but that was the most important one. Most recently in December of 2017 the team at Gebel el-Silsila discovered four intact child burials. One tomb was carved into rock for a child between two and three years old but along with mummy linen they found remains of a wooden coffin as well. Dating to around 1549-1292 BC. <p>

<p>The importance of archaeology is to study human history and prehistory through the excavation of sites and the analysis of artifacts and other physical remains. Since the area is being studied still in 2018 there is still so much to learn. Like in 2017 they found children burials which before that no burial, as far as children, have been discovered. I think it is important because there has been no record of Gebel el-Silsila. The artifacts and things that they have found are now all being recorded. We can look at that information and study it before the site is no longer there. I say that because of incidences like the grave robbery incident I mentioned before. Some people don’t care about that information they are possibly ruining but as far as archaeology goes they care and its exciting to continue further research at Gebel el-Silsila. <p>

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p> Dashur is a royal necropolis complex that contains many of Ancient Egypt’s iconic pyramids.
       This includes the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid, both built by Sneferu during the Old Kingdom. These are the only two pyramids that are not horribly eroded. The White Pyramid, built by Amenemhat II, a pyramid built by Senusret III, and the Pyramid built by Amenemhat III, all are mostly rubble. No pyramids were built after the Middle Kingdom at Dashur. The site was used after mainly for shaft tombs, and eventually for lesser burials, through the New Kingdom. Even with the destruction of some of the pyramids by time, the site is still an impressive monument to the builders of Egypt.</p>

         <h3>Location and Geography</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>Dashur is around 40 km or about 25 miles south of Cairo. It is just south of complex at Saqqara, and 20 miles from Giza.
       It is also near the ruins of Memphis. It sits on the west bank of the Nile, past the edge of cultivation, where land is still arid desert.</p>

         <h3>Site Description</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p> Dashur is part of the field of pyramids that runs to Giza. The pyramids all date from the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom. During the Old Kingdom, the site was built on by Sneferu, a pharaoh of the 4th Dynasty. Sneferu’s reign was seen as a high point of the Old Kingdom (Stadelmann 724). Sneferu moved his court near Dashur in the 15th year of his reign (Lehner 97). He was a very prominent pyramid builder, and built the first pyramid to exist at the Dashur necropolis. He built two large pyramids. First he built the Bent Pyramid. The Bent Pyramid is given its odd shape due to its three stages of building. The original plans had the pyramid at a 60 degree angle. However, this angle was too steep. They reduced it to 50 degrees, and had to enlarge the base of the pyramid to accommodate for the stress of the new angle. The angle was reduced a third time to 45 degrees after it reached 45 meters in height, to help reduce the weight on the substructure (Bard 147). The Bent Pyramid complex contains a long causeway that leads to a valley temple, which is what some consider to be the first, that contains a courtyard with carvings of Sneferu himself (Lehner 101,103). The walled complex also contains small chapel on the east side of the pyramid, and a satellite pyramid to the south (Lehner 104). Sneferu’s court also built mastabas northeast of the Bent Pyramid (Lehner 101). Sneferu’s second pyramid is the Red Pyramid, also referred to as the North Pyramid. There is evidence that at one point it was cased in white stone, but is called the Red Pyramid due to its masonry that has been exposed (Lehner 104). It is a true pyramid, unlike the Bent Pyramid. The complex contains the remains of a mortuary temple, which was rather small due to it most likely being built in a hurry; the remains of a causeway that led to a now ruined valley temple (Lehner 105).
        </p>

      <p> During the Middle Kingdom, Dashur was used again after a long period of abandonment. Amenemhat the II built the White Pyramid in during the 12th Dynasty. It is so named for the white limestone that once clad the outside of the pyramid. Unfortunately, it is now completely ruined, and has been poorly investigated. The complex of the pyramid contains a broad causeway that sloped down to the valley, yet no valley temple has been found (Lehner 174). Senusret the III built a pyramid during his reign as well. It was built improperly, on a poorly chosen plot of land. Due to this it is now ruined. The complex was built in two phases. First, an enclosure wall was built with a small temple on the east and an entrance chapel on the north side for shaft tombs of royal women. The second phase expanded the enclosure wall and added a causeway (Lehner 177). There are also seven satellite pyramids for some of the royal women of Senusret’s reign (Lehner 179). The final pyramid built at Dashur was the pyramid built by Amenemhat the III. It is almost completely in ruin. There were serious errors made in the construction of the pyramid, including building on unstable ground that was too close to groundwater, a too complex interior weakening the substructure, and architects failing to compensate for stress of the ceilings. In fact, before the pyramid had been completed, it had already begun to sink. The complex contains a temple, a causeway and a valley temple. The mortuary temple and valley temple are both completely destroyed (Lehner 181). Past the Middle Kingdom, the site was no longer used for pyramid building. However, there were some New Kingdom burial sites, mainly in the form of shaft tombs, in the northern part of the necropolis (Yoshimura et al 2015). </p>

     <h3>Site Exacvations</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     <p>Dashur has been excavated many times. There a few excavations, however, that are more significant than others.
       One of the most prominent excavations of the site was done by Sir William Flinders Petrie in 1887. In his book, A Season in Egypt, he recounts his expedition to the site. He remarks that he was unable to excavate all of the pyramids due to his short amount of time there. His work shows an early description of the Bent Pyramid, saying that it was “remarkable for being built in two different slopes, the upper part being flatter than the lower, and also for still retaining a large part of its original fine stone casing” (Petrie 27). He did many precise calculations to measure the widths of the bases of the pyramids, their heights, and potentially how they were constructed. Another excavation was done by Jacques de Morgan in 1895-1897. Most of his work focused on the pyramid of Senusret III and its surrounding mortuary complex, where he discovered five boats buried within (Creasman et al 2009).</p>

       <p>  Excavations of Dashur still occur. Recent excavations done by Waseda University in Japan have revealed tombs of named royal scribes and priests. The Tomb of Ipay was discovered 2km north of the Red Pyramid. Stamped bricks within name him as “Ipay, royal butler and royal scribe.” Many grave goods were found within. A stone sarcophagus was also found within Ipay’s tomb. However, it belonged to a man named “Mes, royal scribe and steward” who lived during the rule of Ramses II. South of Ipay’s tomb is a tomb belonging to an individual named Pashedu. The superstructure of his tomb was destroyed, however it predicted that he may have potentially had a small pyramid. Another tomb near that of Ipay was also find by the Waseda University. The Tomb of “Ta, wab and lector priest of Ptah” was found 100 meters west of Ipay’s. Both date to the New Kingdom. The same University excavated other tombs in 2005 found within the area that dated to the Middle Kingdom. They discovered an intact tomb belonging to a man named Senu, located under the tomb of Ta, whose mummy was discovered in a preserved wooden coffin with funerary goods and a funerary mask. Two more tombs were found in 2007, both dating to the Middle Kingdom, and belonged to a husband and wife named Sobekhat and Senetites. That same year, two New Kingdom burials were found with intact wooden coffins belonging to Tjay and Wiay. In the surrounding area, there are many shaft tombs discovered as well. Whether they were not named due to being unexplored or not containing any identifying goods is unclear (“Dashur North”).</p>

    <h3>Significance of Excavations</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
    <p>Each excavation within the site has yielded important information to those who study Egyptian archaeology. The work of Petrie, who was a revolutionary in Egyptian archaeology field, shows his dedication and laid the groundwork for those who came after him. His incredible attention to detail was what allowed this, which can be seen in the pages and pages of calculations within <i>A Season in Egypt</i>. It gave insight into how the pyramids were built, and potentially how they may have looked in historicity. Jacques de Morgan’s excavation of the boats allowed scholars to understand their construction, and see a continuity of boat burials throughout Egyptian history. The Waseda University excavations, while not focused on the pyramids, shows the other uses of the Dashur necropolis. The tomb of Ipay showed a continuous use of a single tomb over multiple dynasties. The tomb of Senu underneath the tomb of Ta shows the re-use of a single burial site, which is also a common occurrence within Egypt. The tombs also uncovered beautiful funerary goods, including intact wooden coffins and funerary masks. These tombs also show that even past the era of royal burials, Dashur was still used well through the New Kingdom for other official’s burials.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Dashur is an extremely important site within Egyptian Archaeology. Home to some of the earliest pyramids, it shows the beginning of an incredible legacy that would last for over four thousand years.The pyramids built show the progression of understanding an architecture that dominates our vision of Egypt. However, its importance is not limited to the pyramids that lie on its grounds. The burials during the New Kingdom show us the connection the Egyptians wanted to make with their past.The site overall shows a progression of Egyptian mortuary practice; shifts in ideology that left physical marks on the landscape that sometimes not even time can erase.</p>

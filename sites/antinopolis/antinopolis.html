<p>The city of Antinoopolis was founded by the Roman emperor Hadrian to honor the memory of Antinous, his former lover, who drowned in the Nile during 130 CE. Antinoopolis was the site of the cult of Antinous, whom Hadrian deified after his death, and who was likened to Osiris due to his manner of death. Architecturally, Antinoopolis was constructed in the Greco-Roman style and contrasted sharply with the Egyptian architecture of surrounding cities. The city had its own Senate and Prytaneus (President), and became the capital of the nome of Thebaid under the reign of Diocletian. In the 4th century CE, Antinoopolois became the seat of a Christian bishop, and is now listed by the Catholic Church as being a titular see. Antinoopolis was abandoned during the 10th century for unknown reasons, and today very little remains of this ancient city. Many of the older structures were removed to make room for sugar factories, however several temple ruins can still be found at Antinoopolis, as well as some remains of a Roman Circus that once existed there.</p>

<h3>Geography of Site</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>The Roman city of Antinoopolis was built on the ruins of an abandoned New Kingdom Egyptian site, located slightly south of the city of Besa. The city was established on a necropolis and the site of a temple of Ramses II. As a center of trade, Antinoopolis was connected by the Via Hadriana--an ancient Roman road--to Berenice Troglodytica, an Egyptian port located on the Red Sea (Encyclopedia Britannica). This connection allowed for trade with India and China, and proved economically advantageous for the ancient city. Located in middle Egypt on the east bank of the Nile River, Antinoopolis, as well as its neighboring city of Hermopolis, was a part of a 15km-wide floodplain (Bunbury, J.; Malouta, M., 2012). There is evidence that the Nile was slowly migrating towards Antinoopolis at a rate of approximately 2.2 km/millenium until 130 CE and then stopped, which “is suggestive of an anchoring of the river by the Roman town by a mixture of revetment of the banks and reduction in the erosive power of the Nile by removal of water for irrigation.” (Bunbury, J.; Malouta, M., 2012) During a visit to Antinoopolis in 1798, French scientist Edme François Jomard described the city as having walls on three sides, with the exception being the side that faced the Nile River itself (Lane, E.W., 1809). Other sources also describe the city as being “walled round.” (Richardson, R., 1822) Pertaining to the structure of the city itself, there is evidence of there having been two main streets, perpendicular to one another, each lined with columns and terminating in gates (Richardson, R., 1822). The city had a trapezoidal shape and a grid-like plan, with streets being divided into quarters and blocks. On the east side of Antinoopolis was a natural valley (also known as a wadi) that bordered a desert landscape.</p>

<p>In “Travels Along the Mediterranean and Parts Adjacent,” Richardson described Antinoopolis in the early 1800s, when what remained of the city was already in ruins. He writes of “broad and spacious [streets], with a row of columns on each side for bazaars, or a shady lounge.” (Richardson, R., 1822) He describes columns of granite and coarse-shell limestone, as well as a “triumphal arc of the corinthian order, which the inhabitants were pulling down by order of the governor.” (Richardson, R., 1822) Some of the columns were said to have had inscriptions that conveyed that they were constructed when Epimevius Honorious was governor, and reference an event involving Septimius Severus. In 1715, Jesuit missionary Claude Sicard journeyed throughout Egypt and wrote the following about Antinoopolis: “[Antinoopolis] presents first to the eye some public buildings of royal magnificence...One can say that this City was one continuous peristyle; from which we can judge that the Emperor Hadrian had as much regard to the convenience of the citizens, as to the magnificence of a monument that he wanted to leave to posterity.” (Sicard, C., 1717) Sicard describes galleries, vaults, the four city gates, a portico, and many piles of stones and columns containing “all kinds of marble.” “La Description de l’Egypte,” the product of a French expedition under Napoleon, contains detailed descriptions of various Egyptian sites including Antinoopolis, as well as sketches of various buildings and column details which give an enhanced view of what the ancient city would have looked closer to in its ancient splendor.</p>

<h3>Excavations</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>To get a sense of the structures, monuments, and overall construction of ancient Antinoopolis, we must look not just to the travel accounts of missionaries and scientists, but also to the archaeological evidence that has been uncovered by anthropologists over the last century. While detailed accounts of the city began to emerge much earlier in history (such as the aforementioned accounts by Jomard, Sicard, and Richardson), archaeological excavations of Antinoopolis did not officially begin until Alfred Jean Gayet’s 1896-1912 excavation. Before this, during the Napolenaic Expedition of 1798 (led by Jormand), large structures such as the city’s theater, triumphal arc, tetrasyla, temples, and a hippodrome were recorded. During Gayet’s excavations, however, he went deeper, looking at mortuary remains, excavating several cemetaries, and discovering funerary portraits such as the Tondo of Two Brothers. Gayet also helped to discover many mummy portraits created on wood and linen (Haeckle, A.E., 2001). One of Gayet’s most important contributions to our modern understanding of Antinoopolis comes from his 1897 paper, “L'Exploration des Ruines d'Antinoë et la Découverte d'un Temple de Ramsès II enclos dans l'Enceinte de la Ville d'Hadrien,” which translates to “The Exploration of the Antinoë Ruins and the Discovery of a Temple of Ramses II Enclosed in the Enclosure of the City of Hadrian.” (Gayet, A., 1897) In this paper, Gayet describes how he and his team discovered the existence of the temple of Ramses II, as well as several previously unknown cemeteries and tombs outside of the main city (Bell, H.I., 1940). Following Gayet’s expedition, John de Monins Johnson and his team excavated Antinoopolis in 1913-1914 on behalf of the Graeco-Roman branch of the Egypt Exploration Society. Unlike Gayet, who focused mostly on cemeteries, mummies, and funerary artifacts, Johnson was primarily interested in papyri (British Museum). While Johnson’s team did indeed uncover important pieces of Classical texts and Christian literature, as well as more everyday documents and records, they also found textiles and garments, currency, hair accessories, metal tools, and even weaving implements (British Museum). This excavation therefore provided broad insight into many different aspects of life in Antinoopolis, including religion, clothing, and finances. Other excavations in Antinoopolis have uncovered temples to Antinous, Isis, and Serapis, as well as Christian monuments, churches, and monasteries. Excavations currently ongoing in Antinoopolis are being lead by the  Istituto Papirologico "G. Vitelli" from the University of Florence and are supported by The Antinoupolis Foundation for specific targeted projects. This project seeks to understand the inhabitants of Antinoopolis and possible reasons for the city’s abandonment during the medieval period.</p>

<p>Archaeological evidence from excavations is essential for uncovering the mysteries of any ancient city, but given how little of Antinoopolis actually remains today, such evidence is absolutely critical for understanding the people, structures, and religion of the city, as well as the role of Antinoopolis in the larger landscape of ancient Egypt. It is because of written accounts from travelers and scientists like Jomard and Sicard, as well as archaeological findings from more modern figures like Gayet and Johnson that we can piece together an image of Antinoopolis as it might have been during the Roman Period. Based on Gayet’s work, we know that Antinoopolis was built atop a temple of Ramses II, which tells gives us some idea about the role of this region before Hadrian declared it to be what we now know as Antinoopolis. From studies of the religious architecture of the city, we know that there is evidence for worship of ancient Egyptian deities, as well as Christian and Islamic traditions. Papyri and analyses of the cities roads and buildings have allowed us to infer that Antinoopolis was a center of trade both within Egypt and with other nations. Ancient accounts, as well as the study of temples in the city, have conveyed the importance of the figure of Antinous in the city’s location and construction in the first place. All of these different pieces of information, including many not mentioned here, give us a better window into the history of this great city, why it was constructed, and the significance that Antinoopolis had in the ancient world.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>What was once the city of Antinoopolis is now mostly gone, not only due to looting and natural weathering, but also due to purposeful deconstruction of old structures in order to make room for the newer structures--primarily sugar factories--of El Sheikh Ibada, as the city is now known. What we now know of ancient Antinoopolis comes from archaeological excavations done over the last century and travel accounts from many hundreds of years ago. Antinoopolis is a particularly interesting city to study from an anthropological standpoint because it is a distinctly Roman city in the middle of Egypt, and both cultures can be seen to influence life in the city, from the Egyptian textiles and mummification techniques to clearly the Roman roads that criss-cross the city’s center. Most early excavations focused on understanding the physical structure of the city and the economic and political roles of Antinoopolis, but only in more modern research has there been a move to focusing on understanding the inhabitants of Antinoopolis and what their daily lives might have been like. Though the structures of this city have mostly been reduced to rubble, there is still much left to uncover in Antinoopolis, and much more to learn about the foundations of this ancient city and the people who lived there.</p>

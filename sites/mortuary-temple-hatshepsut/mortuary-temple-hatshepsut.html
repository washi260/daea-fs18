     <p>Built in the 18th Dynasty by the architects of one of the few female pharaohs in Egyptian history, the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut outshines its close neighboring temples of Nebhepetre-Mentuhotep and Thutmose III. The Mortuary temple of Hatshepsut was built into a limestone rock structure on the West side of the Nile Valley in Thebes (Hatshepsut’s homeland) to honor the pharaoh Hatshepsut.  The temple has three levels, each with a courtyard and various pillars and statues, making it quite the sight to behold.  Excavations at Deir el-Bahari began in the 1800s, however the Temple wasn’t well known to the public until later excavations in the 1920s. Deir el-Bahari is known for multiple temples, though without a doubt The Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut is the largest and most complete, despite efforts of Thutmose III to erase Hatshepsut’s presence </p>

    </figure>

    <p>Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple was her principal achievement in architecture, as it was built according to her own plans. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005), It was built directly out of the side of a limestone cliff, with three levels and many statues and pillars. </p>

    <p>The Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut's location is significant for more than one reason(Location : 25.7382° N, 32.6066° E). The closeness of the Temple of Mentuhotep II’s temple is not coincidence. Mentuhotep II was likely already believed to have brought upon the beginning of the second golden age, because of the placement of her temple next to his Hatshepsut may have been implying that she would also bring upon a golden age. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005). </p>

    <p> It is also very close to the Valley of the Kings, which is on the opposite side of the rock massif from Hatshepsut’s temple.  The temple, also called Djeser-djeser, translated to Holiest of Holies in english, closely follows the same structure of the Old Kingdom pyramid complexes, which is as follows; Tomb, upper temple, causeway, valley temple (Cwiek, 2014).  In fact, the rock structure separating the temple from the Valley of the Kings could be considered a sort of natural pyramid. <p/>

   </figure>

   <p> The Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut is one of the grandest Egyptian architectural achievements. It is very large compared to its’ neighboring temples, and has three levels. It also contains a birth colonnade and a Punt colonnade. The birth colonnade was made for Hatshepsut’s birth, which she strived to depict as godly, and the Punt colonnade was made for her trade expedition to Punt, which was a very important achievement. There were also shrines for both the gods Anubis and Hathor. The Hathor shrine is located on the southern end of the middle terrace (Cwiek, 2014). Anubis has two shrines dedicated to the God, located at the northern ends of the middle and upper terrace (Cwiek, 2014). Two other chapels were placed at the upper terrace and were made to honor the Solar cult and the Royal cult. </p>

<p>The temple was filled with decorations referencing Hatshepsut's legitimacy as King, such as scenes of festivals and in the innermost rooms, scenes of the King offering to the gods. There is also a depiction of Hatshepsut as a sphinx trampling western Asians as well as scenes showcasing Hatshepsut as daughter of her fathers royal body and therefore the legitimate heir to the throne. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005). </p>

<p> Perhaps the most significant feature of the temple of Hatshepsut is the documentation of the trade expedition to Punt located on the second level. Fragmented blocks found on the site pieced together the Queens journey. These blocks depict things such as cattle under incense trees,  a rare rhinoceros, men carrying ebony logs and Puntites giving the leader of Hatshepsut's men gifts ( Smith, 1962). </p>

<h3> Destruction/Defacing</h3>

  </figure>

  <p>Though she was the main ruler of Egypt for about 20 years, Hatshepsut was quickly erased from history. Thutmose III, who was her co-ruler and nephew had ordered for any reference to Hatshepsut's rule to be destroyed.  In the 1920s and 1930s the Metropolitan Museum of Art discovered two great pits with smashed statues from The Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut, which was quickly determined to be the work of Thutmose III. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005).
Much of what the Temple originally looked like has been forever lost because the destruction ordered by Thutmose III. Thutmose III had originally been filling the gaps with offerings, specifically where he stood behind her (this was representative of Hatshepsut being the main ruler and Thutmose III being second to her), though after some time he instead decided to change her temple into one for his father and Hatshepsut’s late husband Thutmose II. Carvings of the female pharaoh were recarved to show Thutmose II. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005). In addition,  on the walls of the temple where Hatshepsut’s name would have originally been written has been scratched out while Thutmose III’s name remains intact directly next to the reference to the female pharaoh.</p>

 <p>Lord Dufferin excavated Deir el-Bahari in 1858, though his work mostly focused on the temple of Mentuhotep rather than Hatshepsut’s temple. This is still significant because of the similarities between the two temples. </p>

<p>An early excavation of Deir el-Bahri beginning in February 1892,  done in part by a Mr. Currelly,  Madame Naville, and Edouard Naville had the temple cleared and partially repaired. This gave a better look at what the temple may have looked like in the 18th century.  Their last campaign which was interested mostly in the architecture also gave more sculptures and names of kings which were either new or little known (Naville, 1906).  Naville mentions the finding of a room in his writings, mentioning how it had looked as if tomb plunderers had made a hole and then closed it off with bricks, however once they removed the bricks they found a door which led to a granite chamber that was built in the same style as those of the pyramids (Naville, 1906). This chamber contained a shrine and many smaller artifacts such as mummy cloth, broken bows and wooden figurines.  Fragments Naville collected from the site were sent to Museums in Cairo, London and New York at the end of his excavation.</p>

<p> Another excavation from the winter of 1926-1927 had five hundred men working at Diel el-Bahir. For the temple of Hatshepsut they began work by clearing the west wall of debris. Doing this exposed a foundation deposit and 96 green glazed scarabs that the earlier expedition of Naville must have missed (Winlock, 1928).  Their total haul of scarabs is mentioned to be one of the most remarkable. However it was the discovery of the numerous mentions of Queen Hatshepsut that really make this collection important. Out of the total 299 scarabs discovered 153 mentioned Hatshepsut with titles such as “Mistress of the two lands, Beloved of Amon, The Kings Daughter, and The Horus” (Winlock,  1928). This excavation erased any lingering doubt that the temple was not founded by Hatshepsut herself. </p>

<p>A Polish conservation project took place on the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut from December 3, 1993 to April 2, 1994. The work was funded by the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and the Polish Centre of Archaeology of Warsaw University (Pawlicki, 1995). During this time workers made efforts to conserve the limestone walls of the Upper Court and Royal Chapels, the plaster of the Anubis Chapel, and reconstruction of the southern wall of the Upper Terrace and a Osiriac statue (Pawlicki, 1995). The basic work included filling is fissures and cracks and making an effort to reduce the amount of humidity affecting the quality of the walls. In the Anubis chapel the team worked on a partly deformed wall, cleaning it of loose rocks and then reinforced it with a stone buttress and a monolithic limestone rock (Pawlicki, 1995). Conservation work is still being done. </p>

 <h3>Results of Excavations</h3>

<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>Lord Dufferin’s excavation did not dwell too deeply into the temple, though it set up a sort of outline for future excavations.</p>

<p>Navilles excavation produced more significant finds, which included repairing some of the destruction of the temple as well as discovering the names of Kings previously unknown. Navilles excavation was the first of the more serious excavations of the site.  </p>

<p>The excavation that took place in 1926 proved the queenship of Hatshepsut, as well as cleaning debris and the findings of many smaller artifacts. </p>

<p>As far as the results of the conservation project goes, work is still ongoing. Though the temple was fairly well preserved there is still a lot of work to be done in order to keep the condition of the temple as it currently is (or better). </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>The Temple of Hatshepsut bares a close resemblance to architecture of the Old Kingdom despite being made in the 18th century. Being the largest temple at Deir el-Bahari the temple lives up to any expectations with its invaluable inscriptions and the complex architecture. The various chapels and courtyards provide us with information such as the expedition of Punt and the destruction of the temple by Thutmose III gives us insights to the relationship between the two pharaohs. Though it was in better condition than the neighboring temple, The Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut still needs conservation work. Perhaps more can be discovered by deciphering the scratched out parts of walls done by Thutmose III, though more work will have to be done before this is possible. </p>

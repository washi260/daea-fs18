     <h3>Dirt Description</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
  <p>The site of Semna was one fortress of a series of Middle Kingdom fortresses established in the reign of Senusret I (1965–1920 BC) on the west bank of southern Nile and founded during the 12th Dynasty (1985–1795 BC) in the Second-Cataract area of Lower Nubia (Smith). Reisner, an American archeologist, documented that there were three forts at Semna: Semna West (Semna Gharb), Semna East (Semna Sherq, also called Kummeh or Kumma), and Semna South (Semna Gubli) (1929). The Semna Cataract has corresponding forts east and west of it named Semna East and West; and roughly one kilometer south of Semna West is Semna South (Reisner 65). At the southern tip of ancient Egypt was the Semna Gorge, the narrowest part of the Nile valley. pharaohs from the 12th Dynasty strategically built those fortresses to control trade traffic by the Nile. Reisner suggested that this Egyptian fort was built in Nubia as protection defense for the Nile against foreign nomadic tribes as well as a fortified establishment for flow of Nubian values into Egypt (1929). Reisner observed, “the southern products, the ebony, the ivory, the pelts, the incense and resin, the ostrich feathers, the black slaves, were as much desired by the kings of the Middle Kingdom as by their forebears” (p. 66).
  </p>

  <p>Reisner investigated the Egyptian forts Kumma and Semna South in 1924 and 1928. The Kumma fortress was rectangular compared to Semna South that was a smaller-squared fortress. Both fortresses included archeological features such as the remains of houses, cemeteries and temples that do not date to the Middle Kingdom, but rather the New Kingdom (1550-1069 BC) (Smith), This implies that Egypt controlled the second cataract region as a piece of their kingdom instead of utilizing it merely as a fortified area.  That could explain the multiple advanced characteristics of Semna’s fort: Reisner notes reinforcement logs for mudbrick walls (albeit the logs increased susceptibility to fires as studies show traces of fire) while Zabkar & Zabkar notes reinforcement stones, and heavily fortified gates and corridors along the Nile (1929) (1982).  Social structure of the Egyptian fortress can be determined by several studies conducted on the archeological artifacts and human remains in its cemeteries. Smith explains that the Semna South fortress supplied regulatory shelter as the men oversaw cargo ships and other transportations of goods from anything in between vesseled or by caravan (p. 107).

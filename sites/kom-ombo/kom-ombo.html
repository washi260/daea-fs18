      <h3>Introduction</h3>
		    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		   <p>Kom Ombo is an ancient Hellenistic Egyptian city that enjoyed the height of its power during the Ptolemaic Dynasty. The specific date when the ancient city emerged is not well documented, but we do know that it’s reign of power lasted from the Ptolemaic Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom. This ancient city is famous for the Temple of Kom Ombo, a unique twin temple that was erected in honor of two gods, Haroeris and Sobek. The temple was erected under the rule of Ptolemy VI Philometor between 180 and 145 BC. Subsequent structural and stylistic changes were made to the temple by later rulers, the successors of Ptolemy VI, as late as the second and third centuries CE (Coppens & Vymazalová, 2010). The Temple of Kom Ombo eventually saw its demise in the form of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, that destroyed much of the impressive twin temple. Human action contributed to the destruction of the temple as well. Some people defaced the structure while others took stones from the temple to use in other structures (Temraz & Khallaf, 2016).</p>

        <p>The city of Kom Ombo is located near a large silt plain, east of the Nile River and south of Gebel El-Silsila. In addition, it is situated between Edfu and Aswan. The geography and geology of this general area contributed greatly to the development, rise, and construction of Kom Ombo (as well as the rest of ancient Egypt). The region surrounding Gebel El-Silsila, located north of Kom Ombo, is littered with Nubian sandstone, which can be found on both sides of the Nile River in upper Egypt. The abundance of sandstone to the north provided Kom Ombo with plenty of materials needed to build their cities and construct their architecture. The twin temples were one such architectural feat that was built with sandstone from surrounding regions. This regional abundance of sandstone would prove to be crucial in the appearance, functionality, and legacy of the ancient Egyptian culture and their empires and cities (Temraz & Khallaf, 2016), (Smith, 2009).</p>

     </figure>




     <p>Undoubtedly, the most impressive part of Kom Ombo is its famous temple. The Temple of Kom Ombo has fascinated and intrigued Egyptian Archaeologists for countless years. This temple is unique in a number of ways and has provided significant insight into the ancient Egyptian world and culture. It’s a very unique structure because it is a double temple. The dualistic nature of this temple’s construction is uncommon and all the more intriguing to scholars and laypeople alike. The temple is one unified structure but is divided into two connected halves, each half representing one god. One side of the temple was made in honor of the crocodile god, Sobek, who was believed to be the creator of the world and the god of fertility. The other half of the temple was made to pay respect to the falcon god, Haroeris, also known as Horus the Elder. The representation of two different gods in one architectural structure is strange as well as fascinating, since most temples are constructed with the purpose of honoring a single deity or deified person, such as a pharaoh (Temraz & Khallaf, 2016).</p>


     <p>Aside from the symbolic oddities, the twin temple in Kom Ombo is impressive just based on the craftsmanship of the structure alone. Everything about the Temple of Kom Ombo is nearly perfectly symmetrical in how it separates the gods Sobek and Haroeris. The mind-boggling craftsmanship and extreme attention to detail reflects the commitment and loyalty the ancient Egyptians had to their gods (Temraz & Khallaf, 2016).</p>

    <p>Interior details of the Temple of Kom Ombo have also been extremely impactful in archaeologists’ understanding of the ancient Egyptian culture. There is a famous depiction inside the temple known as KO 950. This depiction dates back to the second or third century CE and illustrates medical and surgical instruments. These illustrations are part of a larger offering scene, but they provide incredible insight into the technology and medical practices of the ancient Egyptians. Most scholars agree that the instruments illustrated in the depiction are of surgical equipment that was utilized in the Roman culture at that time. It makes sense that the Egyptians included these tools in their depictions since, at that time, they were under Ptolemaic (Greco-Roman) rule. Some of the surgical and medical instruments illustrated include blades, hooks, forceps, probes, knives, boxes, balances, sponges, sachets, flasks, amulets, and a case to store the instruments. It also depicts a Roman Pharaoh kneeling down facing two deities. These deities are the god Heroeris and the goddess Senetneferet. The Pharaoh is handing these two deities the eyes of the gods Ra and Horus. This is significant because the symbolism represents two parts of the land, namely, upper and lower Egypt. The practices depicted shows the Egyptian gods maintaining and refreshing the life and world of the ancient Egyptian people. The depiction is incredibly important because it serves as a unique visual display of how magic and science, the natural and the supernatural, were foundations of the ancient Egyptian culture (Coppens & Vymazalová, 2010).</p>

<h3>Archaeological Background and Excavations</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


     <p>A great deal of modern excavations and field work done at Kom Ombo can be attributed to the initial influential contributions of Edmun Vignard’s work at Kom Ombo and the surrounding areas. Vignard’s publishings on the Sebilian, a paleolithic industry, at Kom Ombo influenced and encouraged new field work at the site. Edmun Vignard’s work, which was completed in the 1920s, is undoubtfully controversial. However, the academic field of archaeology has done a great deal of growing in the decades passed, as we have seen through the emergence of new theoretical, ideological, and methodological frameworks. Modern archaeologists are properly equipped with enlightened thought, convincing many of them to reassess Vignard’s initial analysis. New looks at ancient paleolithic industries at Kom Ombo have corrected much of Vignard’s problematic mistakes and shed light on the unique area surrounding Kom Ombo. The excavations were done to learn about the stone tools of the paleolithic industry (Vignard’s Sebilian) and to correct initial misinterpretations (Smith, 2009).</p>

     <p>These recent excavations sought to illuminate the nature of the people and stone tools involved in the paleolithic industry in ancient Egypt in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene. The results from new excavations at Kom Ombo reveal that the area was environmentally and geographically unique. Through a thorough analysis of material remains, archaeologists have found that multiple different groups of people frequented the area surrounding Kom Ombo. In addition, all these different groups had different stoneworking methods and techniques. This is significant because different stoneworking methods and techniques imply different cultural backgrounds of the people who left the stone tools behind. This discovery adds to our modern understanding of different groups of ancient people and their economic backgrounds and practices. And we have learned through excavations that many of these economic roots are centered in fishing, hunting, and gathering. The results of recent excavations are significant because archaeologists have shown that the region where Kom Ombo lies was not culturally secluded. On the contrary, we can now begin to view this area as a regional transition zone of north African cultures and other cultures south of the Sahara Desert (Smith, 2009).</p>

     <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <hr><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
      <p>The city of Kom Ombo is a fascinating settlement that offers archaeologists, Egyptologists, and other scholars significant insight into the prehistory and history of ancient Egypt. Excavations at Kom Ombo reveal great detail about the prehistoric past in ancient Egypt. Specifically, work done concerning ancient paleolithic industries has shed light on the people, conditions, and settlement patterns that shaped what would become the magnificent Egyptian city of Kom Ombo. The fieldwork done at Kom Ombo is also helpful for Egyptian archaeology as a whole, as many of those findings can be translated to other regions of ancient Egypt. Paleolithic tool industries, as well as the collection and utilization of sandstone, are ubiquitous throughout the ancient Egyptian empire. Understanding how these processes fit into the archaeology of Kom Ombo can help archaeologists explain similar phenomena and patterns throughout the rest of the Egyptian and Nubian landscape. Work at Kom Ombo has revealed the rich, diverse cultural background of the area. Through this, we have learned how ancient people utilized their land, worked stone tools, and moved about the landscape. Observing and studying these patterns show the foundations for the massive civilizations that would soon appear in the Nile Valley.

      The historical studies of the city of Kom Ombo have also been instrumental in understanding the nature of Egyptian history and culture. The Temple of Kom Ombo, specifically, has proven to be highly insightful to ancient Egyptian history. The temple is extremely unique in the dualistic nature of honoring two separate gods in a single architectural structure. The temple has also, through interior depictions, offered a great deal of knowledge regarding ancient Egyptian medical practices and the unification of the natural and supernatural. These illustrations inform us about ancient life, including the beliefs of the ancient Egyptians and the ritual practices they partook in. Ancient Egypt always has been (and always will be) known for its impeccable technological marvels. A look at the depictions and architectural layouts at the Temple of Kom Ombo exemplifies Egypt’s impressive legacy as well as Kom Ombo’s place in this legacy.</p>

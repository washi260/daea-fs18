      <h1>KV20</h1>
      <h3>18th Dynasty</h3>
	  <h4>Elizabeth Sauter</h4>
     <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
    <p>KV20 was one of the very first tombs to be built in the Valley of the Kings.  Constructed during the Eighteenth Dynasty, KV20 was originally Thutmose I’s burial place before he was possibly moved to a different tomb.  The famous pharaoh Hatshepsut was interred there after she died.  Originally discovered by the Napoleonic Exploration in 1799, KV20 was later excavated by other archaeologists, most thoroughly by the famous Egyptologist Howard Carter between 1903 and 1904.  The site is located on the easternmost part of the Valley of the Kings.  It varies from other tombs in the Valley due to its unusual layout and the clockwise corridors, which are considered to be atypical for tombs of that time in the Valley of the Kings.  Conservation has been difficult in the tomb.  KV20 had been looted, and Hatshepsut’s mummy had disappeared, though there was a mummified organ with her cartouche on broken stone vessels that were found inside the tomb upon excavation.  Nonetheless, even with being looted, KV20 is still a vitally important Ancient Egyptian archaeological site for many different reasons.</p>

    <h3>Site Introduction</h3>
   <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
   <p>KV20 is located on the Nile’s Western bank near Luxor (Handwerk) in the Valley of the Kings.  The Valley of the Kings is a royal burial ground, where the tombs have everything necessary for the next world (Handwerk).  The location is near al Qurn, which has a similar shape to the pyramids, so that may have impacted why the kings chose that place for their tombs (“Historical Development of”).  The Valley of the Kings is located on the Western bank because of the Ancient Egyptians' belief that the dead lived in the west, where the sun died (“Ancient Egypt, Pyramids”).  In the Valley itself, KV20 is located in the eastern part, rather close to KV19 (“General Site Information”).  Due to the location and the religious importance of the western bank, KV20 is located in a vital area of the Valley.  The tomb itself was built into the bedrock (Hawass) of the valley, and the corridors were built into limestone and shale (“General Site Information”).  While the tomb is unique in the fact that it is built slightly different from other tombs in the Valley of the Kings, this could be accounted for due to it being one of the first tombs built there.</p>

   <p>KV20 was originally built for Thutmose I, and both he and his daughter, Hatshepsut, were later interred there after their deaths.  Both Thutmose I and Hatshepsut were rulers during the Eighteenth Dynasty in the New Kingdom (“Thutmose I and His”).  While he was the third king of that dynasty (“Thutmose I”), the actual length of Thutmose I’s reign is unknown (“Thutmose I: King”).  His daughter, Hatshepsut, was the fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty (Mark) after becoming regent when her husband, Thutmose II, died (Wilson).  She claimed her royal linage from her father, saying that she had been appointed as his successor (History.com Editors), and ruled for about twenty years (Wilson).  Thutmose III later erased any trace of Hatshepsut, his mother, and possibly moved her mummy as well from KV20 (Hawass), along with the tomb being looted as well (“General Site Information”).  While Thutmose I’s mummy was originally going to be interred there, his sarcophagus was found in a different tomb and Hatshepsut made a larger chamber in KV20 to include hers with her father’s sarcophagus (Bard).  While there were only a few artifacts still remaining in the tomb (Hawass), the tomb is still very important in terms of Egyptian history due to what the artifacts that were found were and what they meant in context of the two rulers' reigns.</p>

   <h3>KV20 Description</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
  <p>KV20 has a very unique layout compared to other tombs in the Valley.  The entrance to the tomb is located at the very bottom of an incredibly sheer cliff (“Historical Development Of”), meaning that Howard Carter, during his excavation, had to lower himself by rope down the cliff to enter the tomb (Bard)!</p>
  <figure style="float: left; width: 35%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

<img src="img/kv20entrace.jpg" width="100%" />

<figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Entrance of KV20. Mark Andrews. Tour Egypt, accessed 16 October 2018.">Image 2</a> - "The entrance to KV20."</figcaption>

</figure>
  <p>The corridors inside of the tomb turn clockwise instead of counterclockwise, like many of the other tombs within the Valley of the Kings (“General Site Information”).  These five corridors turn from east to south to west (“General Site Information”).  While the layout of the tomb is unusual compared to other tombs in the Valley, it does, in fact, include the important necessities that the other tombs have.  And while some thought that the tomb was meant to connect to Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple that she had constructed at Dayr al Bahri (“General Site Information”), other people disagree.  Due to the poor quality of the rock that the tomb was being built into, the architect may have had to change the tomb’s plan (Hawass).  Nonetheless, the layout is still a fascinating component of KV20.</p>

</figure>
  <p>Once one is inside the tomb itself and wants to get into the burial chamber, the blocks that seal the entrance to the chamber need to be removed (Hawass).  Once actually inside, the burial chamber walls are made of shale rock (“General Site Information”) that is incredibly soft, which made it hard for the artisans and craftsmen to decorate the tomb with the required mortuary texts that were needed for the dead to maneuver the afterlife.  Instead, the texts of the Imydwat (“Burial chamber J2”) were written on limestone with red and black ink, and the limestone blocks were thought to have lined the walls (“General Site Information”).  The Imydwat, also written as Imy-Duat, is the royal funerary book, “What is in the Netherworld” (Hawass).  The burial chamber is located on a south-north axis and had three pillars, though only one of these pillars is still intact (“Burial chamber J2”).  On the north side of the chamber, there were two sarcophagi, one for Thutmose I and one for Hatshepsut (“Burial chamber J2”).  While the burial chamber of KV20 is not the most intact of the burial chambers found in the Valley of the Kings, it still provides a glimpse into what Ancient Egyptian society was like.</p>
  <p>Conservation in the tomb has not occurred since Howard Carter excavated the tomb during the early twentieth century (“General Site Information”).  While some tomb corridors have been cut in limestone, others have collapsed due to the soft shale that they were carved into (“General Site Information”).  The tomb has been inhabited by bats, so it smells a lot like bat droppings, as many excavators have noted (Hawass).  In the mid-1990s, there was a flood in the burial chamber that filled it with debris (“General Site Information”).  Many different areas in the tomb are also collapsed or partially collapsed as well.  For example, Gate C2 has a drop in the ceiling level, which may be due to a collapsed ceiling or just a frequent change in the tomb’s corridors (“Gate C2”).  Corridor D2 heads south before bending to the west, and the ceiling has collapsed before the bend (“Corridor D2”).  These issues, ranging from collapsed ceilings to flooding can make the conservation and restoration of KV20 incredibly difficult for archaeologists and Egyptologists.</p>

  <h3>Excavations: Past and Present</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>Most of the excavations done in KV20 have been done before the twenty-first century.  When Napoleon and the French forces arrived in Egypt, the Commission des Sciences et des Arts mapped and planned the tomb in 1799 (“General Site Information”); however, they did not go inside.  In 1817, Giovanni Battista Belzoni (“General Site Information”), an Italian strongman, described the tomb (Hawass) as he mapped and planned it as well.  In the 1824-1825 season, James Burton managed to clear KV20 to the second stairway (Hawass), or corridor D1, along with mapping and planning it (“General Site Information”).  Carl Richard Lepsius mapped and planned the tomb as well during the 1844-1845 season (“General Site Information”).  Conducting the excavation for Theodore M. Davis in 1903 to 1904 (“General Site Information”), Howard Carter fully excavated the tomb, though he did point out that it was a difficult tomb to enter, partially because of the location and partially because of how badly it smelled like bat droppings (Hawass).  He discovered Hatshepsut’s sarcophagus (History.com), and was the one to determine that KV20 was a tomb for both Hatshepsut and Thutmose I (Hawass).  Some recent excavations occurred in KV60, a tomb in front of KV20 (Hawass) during the mid-2000s, searching for Hatshepsut’s mummy; it was eventually found in 2007 (Hawass).  Due to the location and the rough condition of some of the corridors and other areas of the tomb, it is hard to actually excavate in KV20, but, due to the diligence of historical excavations, much is known about the site.</p>

</figure>
 <p>In the burial chamber, a sarcophagus for Hatshepsut and a recarved sarcophagus that was originally Hatshepsut’s that became Thutmose I’s were found during Carter’s excavation (Hawass).  The sarcophagus for Hatshepsut was made of Quartzite, faced south, and rested on plinth blocks (“Burial chamber J2”).  It was decorated with the four sons of Horus, Anubis, Isis, and Nephthys on the exterior, Nut on the box interior and both sides of the lid, along with text (“Burial chamber J2”).  The sarcophagus was 2.45 meters long, 0.87 meters wide, and 1 meter high (“Burial chamber J2”).  Originally made for Hatshepsut, Thutmose I’s sarcophagus was enlarged so his coffin could fit inside, with a length of 2.23 meters, a width of 0.88 meters, and a height of 0.99 meters (“Burial chamber J2”).  It was also made of Quartzite and faced south like Hatshepsut’s sarcophagus, but it was on its side instead of lying flat (“Burial chamber J2”).  Unlike Hatshepsut’s elaborately decorated sarcophagus, Thutmose I’s was decorated with his right and left sides (“Burial chamber J2”).  While no mummies were found in neither the tomb nor the sarcophagi, there were some other ritual burial items that were found in the tomb.  Hatshepsut’s canopic jars were found (Hawass), which are used to store the internal organs.  A box with her royal cartouches was also found, and it had a mummified spleen or liver inside of it (“General Site Information”), along with other organic material since anything body-related had to be buried properly (Hawass).  A single tooth was also found in the box with Hatshepsut’s cartouches (Hawass).  While this box was found near the tomb, not actually in it (Hawass), it still was an important find.</p>
 <p>There are numerous other artifacts that were found in KV20.  During his excavation, Carter discovered a shabti, which is a funerary statuette, and it looks like Hatshepsut (Hawass).  He also discovered stone vessels which had her name on them, along with Thutmose I and Ahmose Nefertari’s names on them (Hawass).  Faience pieces, or glazed ceramics, were found as well, along with head fragments and a small foot piece that might have come from a guardian statue (Hawass).  Other objects that were discovered in KV20 include jewelry, sculptures, tomb equipment, and various vessels (“General Site Information”).  Even though the tomb had been looted, various mortuary artifacts were still found in the tomb.</p>

 <h3>Results and Significance</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Having all of these artifacts in the tomb is vitally important for learning more about the two rulers.  After Hatshepsut’s rule, her son, Thutmose III, tried to get rid of any evidence of her reign (“Hatshepsut”).  With KV20’s discovery and excavations, much can be gleaned about the reign of both Hatshepsut and her father.  Not only that, because KV20 was one of the first tombs to be built in the Valley of the Kings, it provides plenty of valuable information when compared to the other tombs in the area.  Due to its unique layout, it is visually distinct compared to the other tombs; though, as stated above, there are reasons as to why this layout may be different than later tombs.</p>
<p>The artifacts that were found in the tomb can provide fascinating information as well.  The shabti that looks similar to Hatshepsut is one of the few, if not the only one, left of the famous pharaoh’s shabti (Hawass).  This could be a result of either the tomb’s looting or Thutmose III’s erasing anything to do with Hatshepsut after he became ruler of Ancient Egypt – or, possibly, both reasons contribute to the lack of Hatshepsut's shabti.  With modern day CT scans and DNA tests, the mummified spleen or liver and tooth that were found were tested to see if they matched any of the mummies found in KV60, since no mummies were actually found inside of KV20 (Hawass).  While some scientists have their doubts, others, such as Zahi Hawass, the secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, believe that they have indeed found the actual mummy of Hatshepsut (Wilford).  All of these artifacts, and KV20 itself, are helping archaeologists learn more about these two pharaohs.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>One of the earliest tombs built in the Valley of the Kings, KV20 was originally built to only house Thutmose I before being adapted to hold both him and his daughter, Hatshepsut.  It is located on the Western bank of the Nile, and has a distinct layout when it is compared to other tombs in the Valley.  While conservation has been hard to do in the tomb, numerous different excavations, along with mapping and planning KV20, have occurred.  Even with looting, there were still artifacts left to be found, ranging from sarcophagi to jewelry to some mummified remains.  These artifacts, while few, are important because they help archaeologists learn more about Hatshepsut’s rule over Ancient Egypt, and some mummified remains even helped possibly identify her remains!  KV20 might not have as many splendid things that were found in other tombs in the Valley of the Kings, like Tutankhamun's tomb, which was also excavated by Howard Carter, the tomb does provide an important look into Ancient Egyptian society and Thutmose I and Hatshepsut's rules.</p>

<p>Bubastis, also known in Arabic as Tell-Basta or in Egyptian as Per-Bast, was an ancient Egyptian capital from the 22nd Dynasty to its ruin in the 26th Dynasty. The site is known as a center of worship for Bast, the goddess of warfare seen most often as a cat-headed woman, Bubastis serving as the main depository of mummies of cats in Egypt. The site was known for the great temple of Bast, a grandeur structure that thousands would migrate to for the festival of Bast, a festival Herodotus described as a festival of great sexual pleasures and hedonism (3). Today the great temple lays in ruin, all that can be seen now are great blocks of broken monuments, however, many inscriptions listing dates and various Pharaohs survived.

The excavation of the site began in 1887 by Edouard Naville and Francis Llewellyn Griffith who recognized the importance of the Great Temple at Bubastis. Because of their work at the site many Pharaohs who were forgotten in history were able to be identified and their contributions to ancient Egyptian history clarified (2). In 1991 the Tell-Basta Project began, the aim of the project to investigate the Temple of Bastet and the temples relationship to the ancient Egyptian city and how it served the city in terms of spatial organization, regional economy and urban development (1). The last mission to the site was in 2015 but results from the research conducted continues to be published today.</p>

<h3>Regional and Geographical Setting</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Bubastis, or Tell-Basta, is located in Egypts Sharqia Governorate in lower Egypt. The site is on the south-east Nile Delta on the south-eastern edge of the modern day city of Zagazig, about 3 kilometers away from the cities edge (4). The city was the capital of its own nome as the center of worship for Bast.</p>

<h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Bubastis wasn’t recognized as a major city until the Twenty-Second Dynasty. The fascination with the city for rulers traced back to the end of the New Kingdom when major historical events affected the site (5). Ramesses III, after defeating the Libyans, captured them and placed them within military settlements, Bubastis acting as one of the major settlements. The Libyan chiefs held at Bubastis settled at the site for many generations, one of their descendants, Shoshenq, becoming a “leading personality” during the reign of Psusennes II, the last major king of the Twenty-First Dynasty (5). After the death of Psusennes II, Shoshenq ascended to the throne, starting the Twenty-Second Dynasty. His descendants chose the goddess Bubastis, or Bastet or Bast, as their main deity, the great temple in the city possibly serving as a royal residence (5). This can be considered the origin of Bubastis as a major leading city in ancient Egypt and how it became a point of fascination for many leaders and rulers.

Various ancient Egyptian rulers and kings claimed Bubastis as both a site for festivals and temporary residence. Many blocks of the temple are covered in inscriptions by various kings, in the main entrance to the temple the blocks are dominated by inscriptions naming Osorkon I making offerings to various gods (4). The tallest statue ever discovered in the Nile Delta was found in Bubastis, dating to the reign of Ramesses II and thought to be a representation of his wife, Nefertari, however, the inscription was later modified by Osorkon II to say his own name as well as his wife Karomama (4). Many architectural fragments were found with Osorkon II named, showing the king’s sed festival at various stages, all with amazing quality and content shown (5).

Herodotus recorded his observations on this festival of Bast that were found on the architectural fragments:


<blockquote>
	<p>
    “Now, when they are coming to the city of Bubastis they do as follows:—they sail men and women together, and a great multitude of each sex in every boat; and some of the women have rattles and rattle with them, while some of the men play the flute during the whole time of the voyage, and the rest, both women and men, sing and clap their hands; and when as they sail they come opposite to any city on the way they bring the boat to land, and some of the women continue to do as I have said, others cry aloud and jeer at the women in that city, some dance, and some stand up and pull up their garments. This they do by every city along the river-bank; and when they come to Bubastis they hold festival celebrating great sacrifices, and more wine of grapes is consumed upon that festival than during the whole of the rest of the year. To this place (so say the natives) they come together year by year even to the number of seventy myriads of men and women, besides children.” (3)
  </p>
</blockquote>


Herodotus had many pleasant things to say about Bubastis besides the festival, stating that the great temple in the city was“very well worthy of mention, for though there are other temples which are larger and build with more cost, none more than this is a pleasure to the eyes.” (3) He goes on to give a detailed description of the temple and the surrounding city:


<blockquote>
  <p>
    “Except the entrance it is completely surrounded by water; for channels come in from the Nile, not joining one another, but each extending as far as the entrance of the temple, one flowing round on the one side and the other on the other side, each a hundred feet broad and shaded over with trees; and the gateway has a height of ten fathoms, and it is adorned with figures six cubits high, very noteworthy. This temple is in the middle of the city and is looked down upon from all sides as one goes round, for since the city has been banked up to a height, while the temple has not been moved from the place where it was at the first built, it is possible to look down into it: and round it runs a stone wall with figures carved upon it, while within it there is a grove of very large trees planted round a large temple-house, within which is the image of the goddess: and the breadth and length of the temple is a furlong every way. Opposite the entrance there is a road paved with stone for about three furlongs, which leads through the market-place towards the East, with a breadth of about four hundred feet; and on this side and on that grow trees of height reaching to heaven: and the road leads to the temple of Hermes. This temple then is thus ordered.” (3)
  </p>
</blockquote>


Herodotus’s detailed description of Bubastis was later able to be certified by archaeological remains and excavations. Alongside his detailed observations of the festival and the temple, he also caught sight of the worship of cats seen at Bubastis, stating ““The cats when they are dead are carried away to sacred buildings in the city of Bubastis, where after being embalmed they are buried,” (3) In the city, cats were believed to be the embodiment of the goddess Bastet and were placed within the center of the temple, dedicated to Bastet to win her favor (6). There is speculation that cats were even bred to be killed and mummified as sacrifice for Bastet, their bodies possibly being burnt in furnaces instead of embalmed (6). Bubastis serves as the largest cemetery site for cats in Egypt.</p>

<h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The most significant excavation at Bubastis was the Tell-Basta Project, conducted by the University of Potsdam, Germany and the Egyptian Supreme Council for Antiquities since 1991 and later chosen by the EES to be part of the Amelia Edwards Projects (1). The goal of the project was to understand the relationship between the great temple and the surrounding city in terms of spatial organization, regional economy, and urban development (1). The city and the great temple lay in ruin, all that can be seen are giant blocks. It is speculated that the monuments and temple were destroyed by an earthquake 2,000 years ago (4).

In 2008, excavations revealed a Roman building with polished limestone slabs, as well as house structures consisting of ‘tower houses’ which were typical of ancient Egyptian house architecture from the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty into the Roman period (1). In these houses they found tools, pottery, and pigments which indicated a workshop to manufacture figurines, the tools dating back to the Ptolemaic Period. Unfortunately there was no Roman occupation evidence persevered. Along with the houses the excavators found many small objects that related to secular daily life and religious observance: shells, bones, glass coins, statuettes, vessels, and beads (1). The terra-cotta statuettes depicted several motifs and dieties, the most prominent being that of the god Bes (1).

The archaeologists on site speculated that the pottery used in the bricks were from the Late Dynastic Period, indicating that there was activity in the sacred area of the temple during that time (1). They dug a trench at the site, finding pottery from the Late Dynastic Period and large amounts of sherds imported from Levantine and Greek regions (1). No Ptolemaic pottery was found in the deeper walls, indicating that the buildings from the Ptolemaic era were part of an official building program and not of spontaneous house-building (1). Their results proved that the temple continued to be an important temple of Egypt into the Ptolemaic Period and would have benefitted from the attention of Ptolemaic rulers (1).

In the western part of the site 20 blocks were found that represent the remains of shrines (5). Eight different shrines were discovered belonging to four different types able to be identified based on their “architecture, decoration, and function” (5). The first shrine is based on the naos for ‘Bastet, lady of the shrine.’ This shrine was unique in the fact that the naos structure was actually invisible from the outside, the outside walls elaborately decorated with inscriptions showing the king worshipping Bastet (5). The second shrine identified was decorated with long rows of Gods including Osiris, the cycle of creation being the focus of the decoration (5). This second shrine was in the centre of the area where the shrines were found and therefore considered the main naos. The third shrine included mythological text representing the troops of the “Seven arrows of Bastet.” This specific fragment found could be reconstructed at the four corners of the main sanctuary, believed to provide magical protection over it (5). The fourth and final shrine found was dedicated to the minor dieties of Bubastis (5).

Many other fragments of blocks found at the site have important inscriptions naming cult statues of Shesemtet and Wadjet as well as topographical lists consisting of “gods, holy animals, plants or emblems and the accompanying inscriptions always name a specific deity and his/her place of worship,” (5). It is speculated that this list assisted in the performance of rites for the festival of Bastet and various daily rituals (5).

Recently the project discovered evidence of Bubastis being occupied in the Thirtieth Dynasty, a duplicate of the Canopus Decree was found in the entrance area of the great temple. The archaeologists theorized that the face that it was erected at Bubastis meant that the temple still belonged to the three foremost categories of Egyptian sanctuaries, highlighting that the temple of Bastet “was one of Egypt’s most important cult centers for more than six centuries” (4).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Bubastis stands as an important site for ancient Egyptian history, the findings made by archaeologists over the last couple decades have filled in many gaps in Egyptian history especially regarding kings that were lost to history. Although the site may not be much to look at, it still holds many great mysteries and answers to questions we have yet to ask about ancient Egyptian life.</p>

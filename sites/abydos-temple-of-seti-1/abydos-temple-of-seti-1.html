		 <p>The Temple of Seti Ⅰ is a mortuary temple located in northern Upper Egypt, Abydos. The temple was built during the New Kingdom period. Built circa 1300 BC by Seti I and his son, Ramses II, the main monument of the Temple of Seti I contains many detailed reliefs that some would describe as it being among the best of the New Kingdom. Although, The temple of Seti I at Abydos is a mortuary temple, Seti himself was buried in the Valley of the Kings. Made of sandstone and limestone, the Temple of Seti I houses many sanctuaries. One interesting aspect of the Temple of Seti I is the Abydos King List. This list contains the names of 76 kings and pharaohs of ancient Egypt.

     <p>Abydos reached the summit in popularity from the Archaic Period till the Middle Kingdom despite the fact that its most important monuments is the great temple  of Seti I and the little, but charming temple of Ramses II. Seti's temple is famous for its exellent quality high reliefs, as mentioned formerly.

   <h3>Regional and Geographical Settings</h3>
   <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
   <p>Abydos is named in Ancient Egyptian Abdu, Coptic Ebot, modern al-’Arabat al-Madfuna. It is an outstanding city, thus it is one of the most important archaeological sites of ancient Egypt. It is located in the ancient Thinite nome (eighth Upper Egyptian nome) in southern Egypt, and it is about 15 kilometers western the River Nile. It has been reported that it has been linked anciently to the Nile by a canal. Since it stands in Middle Egypt, Abydos is characterized by historical and geographical importance, and the necropolis area of the city was in use from the earliest times and benefited from royal patronage through out its history. It was a cult center of the canine necropolis god Khentiamentiu whose temple existed here from very early times. In the Fifth dynasty, his cult was gradually absorbed by that of Osiris, and the city soon became the focal point of the cult of Osiris. There are two remaining temples located at Abydos: the temples of Seti I and Ramesses II (19th Dynasty – New Kingdom).

    <h3>Site Description</h3>
   <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
   <p>The modern name Abydos was developed by the Greek from the ancient name Abdju. The name of the nome or administrative district was Ta-wer, meaning “The Great Land”. The holy site of Abydos has a special charm, unparalleled with any place of antiquity. The site of Abydos induces a feeling of mystery and holiness in the respective visitor. The temple of Seti I has a majesty, here you can meet the spirit of the great warrior King. Walking on the little sand hills north of Seti’s  I, and Ramases’ temples towards Shunet el-Zebib. You get a glimpse of a lost civilization of the first two dynasties, and you feel a kind of religious mystery which was a characteristic of most holy sites of ancient Egypt. The ground is full of broken pottery,pieces of cloths, bones, remains of sun-dried bricks.

   <p> Most Egyptian temples are built to the same ground plan, but the temple of Seti Ⅰ deviates form it completely; the forecourt and pylons which lead up to its main entrance are destroyed, but the interior of the temple is wonderfully preserved. Seven chapels, all side by side form the centre and core of the structure, and each of these must be regarded as a special sanctuary. The sanctuaries were roofed with rounded arches cut from stone blocks, just like the large stone sarcoghi with their covers hollowed out on the inner side, intended to represent the starry heaven that curves over the world and dead. At the farther end of each, a hollow niche may be seen where a statue of the divinity once stood, and in the doorpost the holes to which door hinges were fixed, are still visible. In each of these sanctuaries a great god was worshipped. In the centre one was Amun, the great god of Thebes; to his left were Haramachis, god of Heliopolis, Ptah of Memphis, and Ra, the sun god; to his right the Triad of Osiris, Isis and Horus. Seven doors, all walled up nut for one led into the temple through the two vast pillared halls, which must be passed through to reach the sanctuary. In the first hall, the ceiling was supported by 24 columns, and in the second, which was larger ad finer, by 36. In the former there were four, and in the latter 6 groups of six, and the ways left open between these group columns led straight up to the door of the sanctuary, as did those between the outer columns and the wall. The ancient visitor who approached the chapel of Amun through the centre opening saw to the right and to the left and wherever his eyes might turn, nothing but pictures and inscriptions of Amun, while anyone approaching  the sanctuary of Osiris between the rows of pillars to the right, saw nothing but those referred to the rule or the underworld. Similarly each of the ways leading up towards the seven vaulted chapels at the further end of the second great hall was richly decorated according to the same principle. Only the highest priests and the king could enter the scared halls.

   <h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
  <p>Explorers and archaeologists working at Abydos since the early nineteenth century have largely focused on the stone remains left behind by the ancient pilgrims, particularly the impressive buildings inscribed and decorated by kings and the high elite. Despite the wealth of objects in museums worldwide that derive from Abydos, it is really only in the past 35 years that we have any idea of the setting and context of most of this material, largely through excavation since 1967 carried out by the University of Pennsylvania-Yale University-Institute of Fine Arts, New York University Expedition to Abydos (co-directors David O'Connor and William Kelly Simpson) working closely in cooperation of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of Egypt. The Abydos Expedition has done much to place earlier discoveries in perspective, and has added volumes of new data on ancient activity at Abydos through exciting discoveries which in many cases rival those of Flinders Petrie's generation.

  </p>

<br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->

<p>Each season of excavation since 1986 has seen important results that are of interest in isolation, but combined together enable a re-evaluation of one of Egypt's most important ancient centers. Clarifying the relationship between temple, town, and cemetery is a thread which connects much of the work done at Abydos in the past three decades. In a basic way, this means looking at the fugitive brick and organic remains of towns and cemeteries, and turning our attention to deriving information from careful excavation of badly destroyed ancient buildings which were often neglected by earlier archaeologists and explorers. Careful attention to traces of domestic activity, most often preserved in the architecture and trash of fallen-down brick and mud houses, is significantly fleshing out our picture of life in this ancient place.

</p>

<br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->

  <p> In recent years at Abydos, re-excavation of sites that were identified and partially studied a century ago has repaid the effort. Modern approaches, techniques, and questions, as well as a more deliberate and meticulous approach, has revealed new detail about long-known parts of Abydos, and has revealed that far more remains to be found than one might expect. The discovery of battle scenes depicting Ahmose's defeat of the Hyksos is but one vivid example of the value of returning to a site thought to be long-since exhausted. Finally, entirely new and surprising discoveries await archaeologists at Abydos.

     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
    <p>Abydos was thought to be the entrance to the “underworld”. For the ancient Egyptians, there was no better place to be buried than at Abydos. Even the living were attracted to make a pilgrimage here, thinking of it as the centre of their religious universe. Temple of Seti the I is not only significant for its amazing structure and beautiful artworks, but also because it was not only built for Seti, but for the kings of Egypt that Seti recognized as being legitimate and for the gods who were seen as significant in the sector/region. Today, this monument is still visited and marveled at like it was just finished being built during the New Kingdom. With past and present excavations, archaeologists are excited to see what new discoveries they will excavate at Abydos.

  	 <p>Deir el-Medina, also known by its ancient name Set matt or “The Place of Truth”, was a worker’s village, on the west bank of the Nile across from Luxor, whose residents were the artisans who constructed the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens (Davies, 1999). The community was made up of craftsmen, painters, scribes, sculptors, and other types of workers who were considered to be some of the best in their respective positions. It is one of the best and most thoroughly documented communities in the ancient world. The first datable remains from this site date back to the reign of Thutmose I in the 18th dynasty and lasted until the Ramesside Period in the 20th dynasty. The primary job of the villagers was to build the tombs in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queen, but it was also a popular pastime for the villagers to work on their own tombs when they had time off, which were no less detailed or impressive than those they had built for the Pharaohs. The villagers, although make up of working-class men and women, were among the most literate communities in ancient Egypt, which correlates with the amounts of papyri and ostraca found at the site, as well has having a higher than average income for their social class. Much of the archaeological evidence found at this site details the administrative and business side of the work put into the building of the tombs as well as insight into the lives of the villagers themselves.</p>

 <p>The village was located to the south of Cairo on the west bank of the Nile, opposite the modern site of Luxor, formerly known as Thebes. It is also located to the north of the Medinet Habu (Meskell, 1998). It is located between the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, far enough away that, during their ten-day work week, the workers would spend eight or nine in huts on the path leading from the village to the Valley of the Kings and would only go back to the village during their weekends. The village was structured in a rectangular format and was around 5600 square meters in area. The southern area of the site consisted primarily of dumps and cemeteries. The western side was primarily used for housing the workers and their families. They layout of the village implies that it was a very cramped and did not have a lot of extra space available. Most of the buildings were made up of mudbrick and were built with staircases leading to the roof, that have been unusually well preserved with complete wall decorations, ritual and domestic fixtures and statuettes, and other important details that tell us about the ancient people who lived there.</p>

<p>The site is primarily made up of a village settlement, two cemeteries, and an area made up of chapels and temples (Gobeil, 2015). It was created in order to house the workmen and administrators who were working on the royal tombs, along with their families. Their community was made up of about 70 terraced houses that were laid out on either side of an alleyway that divided the settlement into two halves, each of which was supervised by its own foreman. It also contained around thirty votive chapels that are thought to date back to the Ramesside period. The building of the village is believed to have begun during the 18th Dynasty under the reign of Tuthmosis I and was expanded in the 19th and 20th Dynasty’s when the workload was at its peak. It is believed to have fallen into disuse after the tombs were completed during the Ramesside period under the reign of Ramesses XI, with the residents moving to other similar workers villages where they were able to find more work. The actual number of villagers seemed to fluctuate depending the royal administration and how in demand their craft was. For example, by the end of the reign of Ramesses II, when the royal tombs had been finished, there were only around 30 workers in the village (Davies, 1999). One of the most common pastimes of the villagers, when they were not working on the royal necropolis, was to work on their own tombs, resulting is around 400 tombs being located in and around the village. There were also many temples dedicated to all different types of gods and goddesses from Hathor, a very popular deity, to the snake headed goddess Meretseger, who was supposed to protect the workmen from snakes.</p>

</figure>

<p>The site was first discovered between 1811 and 1815 and was excavated by scholars around the world, until the French Institute was formally given concession in 1917. Bernard Bruyere from the French Archaeological Institute in Cairo is one of the most prominent excavators and contributors to our knowledge of the site. He and his teams made four different trips to Deir el-Medina with their first excavation beginning in 1922 with the last ending in 1951. During these excavations they found the houses of the workmen, tombs, documentary and literary documents, and limestone flakes called ostraca. One notable find was the intact 18th Dynasty tomb of a villager named Sennefer in 1928. This was noteworthy because many similar types of tombs had been plundered long before the team had arrived in Egypt. The tomb contained the coffins of Sennefer and his wife as well as items such as flowers, statuettes, pieces of furniture like chairs and tables, jewels, vases, and food that had been left for them by their families. (Gobeil, 2015) Another important find by this team came towards with their final excavation of the site in 1951. Bruyere received information from local Egyptians that there was a Late Period tomb in the area that had not been discovered yet and he was determined to find it. He was forced to self-fund the excavation and did not have the means to use any machinery for the digging. Rather than finding the tomb the team was expecting, they found a rubbish dump used by the villagers. Although this was initially disappointing, the dump site contained more than 5,000 ostraca, the translation of which has revealed that they were documentary and literary archives of the community, giving archaeologists and Egyptologists an insight into the village and its workings that they had never had before.</p>

<h3>Results and Significance</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Deir el-Medina was a government created settlement intended to house the specialized craftsmen and workers that built the royal tombs and is therefore a main source of New Kingdom administrative documents, providing information about the government and the administration of the village functioned. At this site, archaeologists have found a mass of documentation that provided insight into the cultural, political, and economic workings of their society. (Haring, 2003) They also detailed the techniques that the workmen used and the bureaucratic organization of the workforce. There have been many literary and non-literary texts found at the site, such as codes of behavior, poems, spells, records of necropolis administration, and private business documents. Because of the specialization of the work that they did, including the painting and chiseling of hieroglyphs in the tombs, and the close contact the workers must have had with government officials, such as scribes and viziers, the villagers are considered to be one of the more literate communities in ancient Egypt and are thought to have earned income that would have been above average for their social class. The findings at Deir el-Medina have provided information about the daily lives of ancient Egyptians as well as provide insight into the bureaucratic aspects of the culture and giving us details about how the government functioned in the New Kingdom era of ancient Egypt. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>In conclusion, Deir el-Medina was a successful workers village made up of a very literate and talented craftsmen that were entrusted by the royal admiration to build the tombs that would house their Pharaohs for their afterlives. They were the best of the best in their fields and appear to have been a very successful village until they their skills were not needed anymore. Even after the workers left, Deir el-Medina was an important religious and mortuary site, containing several chapels and temples. Much of the archaeological evidence found at the site has provided information about the lives of the people of the village, how they lived and worked, as well as provided information about the villager’s relationships and communications with the governmental figures in charge of the building to the royal necropolises. It has become a very important site for archaeologists and Egyptologists who are looking to understand the everyday lives of the people in ancient Egypt or want to understand the New Kingdom administration. The village also made it possible for the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens, arguably some of the most important sites of ancient Egypt, to be built. Even though it was a planned government created community, the villagers made it their home, and many were even buried at the site, proving the importance that the village had to its residents and to the people of Egypt in general.</p>

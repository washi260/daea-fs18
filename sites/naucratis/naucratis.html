		 <p>Naucratis is an archaeological site discovered in 1884 by Sir William Flinders Petrie, located on the western branch of the Nile delta. The only information on the site at that time were the writings of Herodotus, a Greek historian, and Petrie references his writing often in his records of his excavations. The site has suffered much destruction through the ages, and presently is mostly underwater, but has undergone several excavations allowing archaeologists to gather the information they have on the site today. (Moller) Petrie placed Naucratis’ establishment around 670 B.C., and it was the only trading port in Egypt where Greeks were allowed (Winslow 2). Therefore, much of the archaeological evidence at the site points at the presence of the Greeks at Naucratis. Most notable is the pottery; many styles of Greek pottery have been found at Naucratis. Some have even suggested that one style, Chian pottery, was even produced at Naucratis, due to a combination of Greek and Egyptian techniques (Moller 136). Another indicator of Greek presence at Naucratis were several temenos, or sacred enclosures, dedicated to Greek deities (Muhs 99). Other notable features include the Great Mound, the Great Temenos, a cemetery, and the Scarab Factory.</p>

     <h3>Location</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->



<p>Naucratis is located in the Nile delta, off the western (Canobic) branch of the Nile near the modern town of Kom Ge’if.  In ancient times the Nile was supposed to be much closer to the site, but today they are not connected (Villing). There is debate over whether the original location of Naucratis was on the east or west bank of the Nile. Petrie believed it to be on the west bank, basing his claims on the writings of Herodotus, but most other scholars believe it to have been on the east bank. During Petrie’s first excavation a part of the site was underneath a local cemetery, which before being built about 30 years before Petrie got there was a chapel, which did help with some of the preservation of the site by keeping locals away. When Petrie tried to work around the cemetery, he was asked by the owners of the cemetery to help relocate it (Muhs 102). Today much of the site is underwater, making further excavations difficult, and there is nothing there to attract tourists, so it is relatively abandoned. Furthermore, it is not connected by any main roads, making it difficult to get to (Moller 89). </p>

  <h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Ancient Naucratis consisted of several temenos; the Temenos of Apollo, Dioskouroi, and Hera, as well as the Hellenion, the Great Temenos, the faience workshop, or the Scarab Factory, and the cemetery. Even during the first excavation by Petrie, there was not much left of Naucratis due to the elements and especially sebakhin, where locals would take remains of a site and use them as high phosphate fertilizer (Moller 90). There was nearly nothing left of the temenos other than pottery shards, which helped Petrie to identify the remnants. The Temenos of Apollo is located in the northern part of the site, and identified through the use of pottery bearing inscriptions located on site. Petrie’s first excavation only found bits of remaining walls and the floor. Petrie believed there were two temples in the Temenos of Apollo. The Temenos of Dioskouroi was located to the north of the Temenos of Apollo, and was similarly identified through inscriptions in the pottery shards found on site. Like the Temenos of Apollo, the Temenos of Dioskouroi was also found in ruins, with only parts of the walls remaining. The Temenos of Hera lies to the west of the Temenos of Apollo and Dioskouroi, and was in the worst state of destruction compared to the others. The Temenos of Aphrodite was the most well preserved of all the Temenos at the time of excavation. It consisted of three temples. The Hellenion was a collection of buildings with chambers containing pottery devoted to many Greek deities such as Aphrodite, Heracles, Artemis, and Poseidon located in the north-east area of the site. (Moller)
  </p>
<p>The Great Temenos, notably larger than the other temenos, was only partially preserved due to being built over by a modern cemetery (Muhs 99). Petrie placed the original height of the building at 40 feet, but was only around 5-10 feet when he arrived (Moller 108). Within the Great Temenos was a building called the Great Mound, a mud-brick building Petrie ascertained as some sort of stronghold and storage area, due to the many chambers in the building. According to Petrie it had originally been 50 feet high, and there were still about 30 feet standing when he first excavated, but excavation by Hogarth found no evidence of the Great Mound, and he suspected Petrie may have only recorded stories told by the locals (Moller 111). The faience workshop, or the Scarab Factory, is located in the south-west area of Naucratis across from the Temenos of Aphrodite. Faience is a manmade synthetic material, and the workshop was used to create tools, and trinkets such as scarabs, hence the name ‘Scarab Factory’. (Moller) Finally, a cemetery lies in the north of the site, containing burials from the 5th century B.C. (Villing).

<h3>Excavations</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>There have been four main excavations at Naucratis, respectively done by William Flinders Petrie (1884), Ernest A. Gardner (1885), David G. Hogarth (1899), and William D.E. Coulson and Albert Leonard (1980). Petrie located Naucratis through the use of ancient writings from Herodotus, a Greek Historian, and through tracking artifacts on the market (Muhs). Petrie’s excavation revealed the Temenos of Apollo, the Temenos of Dioskouroi, the Temenos of Hera, the faience workshop (or the Scarab Factory), and the Great Temenos. Even upon Petrie’s first excavation, much of the site was destroyed due to sebakhin. Petrie published his results in ‘Naukratis Part I’ in 1886. Many of the artifacts, mostly pottery sherds, that were recovered were taken back to the Petrie Museum in London.</p>
<p>The second excavation took place from December 1885 through March 1886 by Ernest A. Gardner. Naucratis had been further destroyed. He continued excavation on the Temenos of Hera, Dioskouroi, and discovered the Temenos of Aphrodite. Gardners findings were published in “Naukratis Part II’ in 1888. The third major excavation took place in 1899 by David G. Hogarth, who found Naucratis in further ruins through sebakhin, and that water levels had already begun rising in the areas where Petrie and Gardner had excavated. Hogarth took on new excavation areas to the north and south of Petrie and Gardner’s areas. Hogarth discovered the Hellenion, and was able to further excavate the Great Temenos. Hogarth also returned for a fourth excavation in 1904. </p>
<p>In 1980 William D.E. Coulson and Albert Leonard returned for a 5th excavation. At this point in time the lake made excavation very difficult on old excavations sites. They focused on stratigraphy and coring.  (Moller) In 2012 the British Museum started the Naukratis Project, and has been using modern techniques such as magnetometry to study the site. They have determined the site is actually much larger than previously believed, and are currently preparing publications (Villing).

<h3>Results</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Through these excavations, archaeologists were able to map out the site of ancient Naucratis, and through artifacts recovered, determine the use of the structures, and Naucratis’ relationship with Greece. The majority of the artifacts discovered at Naucratis consisted of pottery sherds. There were several different styles of Greek pottery recovered, and the locations these styles originated from allows scholars to understand where Greeks in Naucratis may have come from (Villing). The pottery inscriptions were also able to assist archaeologists in determining what functions buildings served. Without the pottery remains, the deities each temple was dedicated to may never have been found out because of the poor condition the site was found in. </p>
<p>Other artifacts found include faience figures and scarabs. The faience figures and faience molds are what allowed archaeologists to determine the location of the faience workshop at Naucratis. However, the actual faience workshop and products leads to further questions about interactions at Naucratis. Egyptian and Greek faience is difficult to tell the difference between and many of the faience figures found show both Greek and Egyptian characteristics, so the question of whether it was Greek or Egyptians who worked in the factory is still unanswered (Moller 152). Many of the scarabs made at Naucratis have been traced to many other places in the Mediterranean, also suggesting who came to trade at Naucratis (Moller 154).

     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>Naucratis is an important site in Ancient Egypt because it reveals the interactions between Greeks and Egyptians. During its time it was the only port open to Greeks in Egypt, but it has been related to other sites in different time periods where Greeks and Egyptians also cohabited such as Tel Defenneh (Moller). The finds at Naucratis also show the influence Egypt had on Greek art. Chian pottery and scarabs found on site contain both Greek and Egyptian characteristics, leading scholars to question who actually made them. “Greek honeysuckle”, a pattern found on pottery from excavations at Naucratis, were found to be a different version of Egyptian papyrus decorations (Winslow, 4).</p>
<p>Naucratis also provides insight into the world of archaeology and Egyptology through its rich history of excavation. Excavation at this site started in 1884, and through the various excavations over time the changes in methods and available technology can be seen. Petrie is important because he was the first to excavate the site, and being that he got there with the most of the site intact before any other excavators, his information provides the basis of what is known about Naucratis. However, his methods and conclusions have been questioned and challenged by those who worked there after him due to better technology (Moller). Afterall, Petrie based many of his conclusions on ancient writings from Herodotus, such as Naucratis’ situation on the Nile, and may have based his results more on local stories rather than what he actually found (Moller). Another part of Naucratis’ history that is also important at other sites and in overall Egyptology is the preservation, or destruction, of a site and the impact this state has on excavation. Even upon it’s first discovery, Naucratis was in very poor condition, largely due to sebakhin. It is interesting to see how the destruction of an important archaeological site can benefit locals, in this case, as a boosted fertilizer. Nature as well as local humans impacted Naucratis, as it is now covered by a lake. Archaeologists focus on the past, but they also have to deal with all the problems at a site that have resulted since the people they are studying inhabited it. These problems and the contradictions between opinions of different archaeologists become apparent when looking at Naucratis’ history, and all are important to take into account to understand the site.

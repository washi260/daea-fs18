     <p>In Upper Egypt lies the captivating archaeological necropolis known as El-Kab, or Nekheb in the ancient Egyptian. This massive burial ground contains the mortuary temples and tombs of numerous important rulers, and citizens of the ancient city of Nekheb, as well as remains of important ancient Egyptian figures from regions all over Egypt. The city flourished from the early Neolithic/Predynastic periods up until the Ptolemaic period. The city of El-Kab was constructed not only as a thriving urban city for ancient Egyptian citizens, but with great religious importance as well. El-Kab inherited its original name, Nekheb, from the principal deity of the city, Nekhbet, the vulture goddess of ancient Egyptian theology and one of two guardian deities of Pharaoh (Huyge 2013). A once powerful city in ancient Egyptian society, it is now the resting place of thousands of Egyptian citizens, soldiers, and rulers, and encaptures the mysticity of ancient Egyptian life.</p>



     <h3>Geography of El-Kab</h3>
 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


 <p>El-Kab is an expanse of burial sites, mortuary temples, and ancient monuments that covers approximately 16 square kilometers of land on the east side of the Nile River in Upper Egypt, about 50 miles north of Thebes (Huyge 2013). The site is located in a harsh, desert terrain at the mouth of a vast valley of sand. The greatest monumental portion of the site the enormous, brick wall that encloses the entire city area. The wall encloses an area of about 71 acres, and is an incredible 40 feet thick (Breasted 1897). It’s height is mostly intact, standing at about 20 feet tall. The wall was most likely constructed in the New Kingdom, presumably during king Nektanbo II of the fourth century B.C. (Huyge 2013). Outside the wall is a desert poo pourri of broken pottery and old stone artifacts. Curiously though, hardly any pottery was discovered inside the walls — only in the surrounding desert area. </p>

<p>Aside from the site within the walls, there is also an area outside of 18th dynasty tombs, numerous cemeteries outside the wall, and other temples further into the desert region surrounding the city walls. Surrounding temples include the temple of Amenhotep III, the rock of graffiti, and the temple of Rameses. (Quibell, 1898). Irrigation at El-Kab would have been difficult not only because of the water level, but because of a somewhat thin layer of deposited mud that settled rather than the common, rich soil that surrounds the Nile floodplains (Clarke 1922). Near site K in Image 3 stands a collection of poorly built but thoughtfully arranged houses, constructed of large stone pieces and low-quality mud used to keep it stuck together. The homes seem to be of the Ptolemaic era, as much of the sites constructs are. The sandstone that the buildings and monuments were constructed out of appeared to have been collected entirely from the surrounding hills (Clarke 1922). </p>

<h3>History of El-Kab</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


<p>El-Kab most likely began as one of the first urbanized civilizations in ancient Egypt. During the time of the New Kingdom, El-Kab was designated as the capital of the third nome of Upper Egypt (Huyge 2013). While there is evidence of this, there is also evidence that surrounding the time that El-Kab was thriving with inhabitant, the Nile River was actually at a lower level than it is today, making the land apparently very uncultivable (Clarke 1922).</p>

<p>A strong irrigation system would have to have been in place for the citizens of El-Kab, in it’s prime, to cultivate the land and prosper. Image 3 provides an outstanding hand-drawn map of the city walls and surrounding temples, tombs, and mastabas. There were trace elements of natron along the ancient roadway leading to the city, near a 12th dynasty burial ground, which was believed to be a reputable resource in ancient Egypt used for purification purposes. This suggests the wealth of the city was notable, and had access to resources of value in the nearby areas.</p>

<p>El-Kab is believed to have been inhabited beginning approximately 7000 B.C.E., at the beginning of the Neolithic period (Huyge 2013). During the years leading up to this, the ancient Egyptians would have been transitioning from nomadic, hunter-gatherer communities to stationary communities based on agriculture and animal domestication. Evidence for the introduction of stone tools, the making of pottery, and agriculture support this time frame as the beginning of El-Kab. The establishment of successful urban cities came with the shift into the Predynastic period with the growth of the Naqada culture around 4000 B.C. The development of writing occurred during this period, as well as the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt in accordance with the economic and social complexities of the Upper Egyptian Naqada culture. </p>

<p>The Dynastic period (approx. 3100 B.C. to 2500 B.C.) brought along the growth of an administrative hierarchy dominated by Pharaoh and supported by the theological belief in the deification of Pharaoh. The Old, Middle, and New Kingdom periods allowed the area to prosper as an economic power, especially with its proximity to Thebes. However, this brought heavy looting to the earliest of tombs, the exact dates of which are uncertain (Quibell 1898). It was during the Middle Kingdom that many large, private subterranean tombs were constructed under mastabas.</p>

<p>There is evidence of the occupation of the Hyksos at El-Kab, who controlled northern Egypt for 108 years until their reign ended by the first king of the 18th century, Ahmose (Clarke 1922). Many of the excavated cemeteries at El-Kab were discovered to be burials of Hyksos soldiers, which is also depicted in wall artwork at El-Kab. In fact, the Hyksos sphinx displayed at the Cairo Museum was dug up near the area (Clarke 1922). El-Kab remained an inhabited city until the Ptolemaic dynasty (330 B.C.), after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great. The new reigning power in Egypt brought to an end the traditional pharaonic hierarchy, and Egypt entered a new period of Greek-style culture and economy (Bard 2015). </p>

<p>The most incredible, and archaeologically important features of El-Kab are the temples and mastabas, which contain detailed histories of the people of El-Kab, and the lives of those whom the temples were erected for. The Temple Group, marked A on the map of Image 3, was estimated to have been constructed around the time of the 26th dynasty based on the textual evidence on the walls inside.</p>

<p>The oldest stone blocks within the town were originally part of the now-collapsed shrine built by Sobekhotep III in the 13th Dynasty. Also within the city is an important Naqada III cemetery with simple, shallow pit graves containing a mass of well-preserved artifacts belonging to the deceased, many of which were forms of pottery. An important structure at El-Kab is the Wadi Hilal of the Old Kingdom, estimated to have been constructed during the 6th dynasty or so. The Wadi Hilal is decorated numerously in petroglyphs that detail various historical events from history leading up to its construction, shown in Image 4. Image 5 depicts the petroglyphs of the Temple of Nekhbet, constructed by Amenhotep III in honor of the vulture goddess (Limme 2008). The temple is dated to have been constructed during the Late Dynastic period, during the 29th and 30th dynasties (Huyge 2013).</p>

<p>The Temple of Ahmose, Son of Ebana, is most famously known for its incredible petroglyphic autobiography of Ahmose, detailing his great triumphs over the Hyksos invaders (Huyge 2013). Ahmose is said to have been honored with the Gold of Honor, a prestigious honor bestowed for truly heroic conquests, not only once, but seven times (Bard 2015). Other famous tombs include those of Paheri, Reni and Setau (Huyge 2013). The burial of Irtenakhty, a priestess of the goddess Hathor, is also intact at El-Kab (Limme 2008).

<h3>Excavations at El-Kab and their Importance</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


<p>Excavations at the site of El-Kab have provided a deep understanding of the lives, and deaths, of ancient Egyptians of all classes and jobs throughout a great expanse of history. Important findings about the smaller burial grounds at El-Kab were carried out by J.E. Quibell, who went on to write numerous books and journals about the site. Quibell’s first excavation, done in the 1800s, was of a cemetery to the east of the town, where he discovered many buried skeletons, none of which had undergone mummification. The cemetery was deemed the oldest at the site based off of the cultural artifacts found there (pottery, beads, painted slabs, etc.), and the lack of artifacts containing written text (Quibell 1897).</p>

<p>Other important findings came from Somers Clarke’s interpretations of the archaeological findings he discovered in his numerous excavations of the site with J.J. Tylor (Quibell 1898). Clarke made his first exploration of the site in 1893, and was also involved with various restorations at the site. He returned to work on the tomb of Sobek Nakht in 1896, the temple of Amenhotep III in 1898, and the tomb of Renni in 1900. (Griffith Institute, 2015). Ongoing excavations include the discovery of remains of buildings from the early Old Kingdom period, around the time of the ruling 3rd and 4th dynasties (Huyge 2013).</p>

<h3>El-Kab, in Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->


<p>As the one of the largest and oldest necropolises in ancient Egyptian archaeology, El-Kab holds some of the most valuable secrets about the lives of the ancient Egyptians, their religious beliefs and practices, their mortuary techniques and burial practices, and the hardships and victories they encountered. The collection of temples and monuments erected here represent the power of ancient Egypt, and the respect and honor they held for their deceased. The once-flourishing city turned mass necropolis is now an archaeological treasure chest, where the historical value is priceless.</p>

		 <p>The Precinct of Mut is a temple compound within the larger Karnak Temple complex. The precinct was used as a religious center for much of the New Kingdom, Third Intermediate Period, and Late Period. The precinct was dedicated to the goddess Mut, who was known as the Queen of the Goddesses and the consort of Amun-Ra. The precinct contains at least six temples. Surrounding three sides of the main Temple of Mut is a lake that was considered sacred, called Isheru. The site is well known for the hundreds of statues dedicated to the lioness-headed goddess, Sekhmet, found there. The Mut Precinct recently reopened to the public in 2014 (2).</p>

<h4>Who was Mut?</h4>

     <p>The goddess Mut, pronounced "Moot," was part of the Theban Triad, alongside her husband, Amun, and their son, Khonsu (5). Mut was usually depicted in human form wearing the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, something usually reserved for kings and pharaohs, making her often interpreted as being closely linked to the kingship and being a protector of it (1). Other ways Mut was closely linked to the kingship was by being connected to cities of power, such as Memphis and Thebes (1). Mut also belongs to a group of goddesses called the Eye of Re. This group of goddesses were primarily as having the heads of cats or lionesses (2). Mut's Eye of Re form was known as Sekhmet, whose name meant "The Powerful" and who was also deeply connected to protecting the kingship (5). However, if not appeased with the proper rituals, Sekhmet could also destroy that which she protected (2).</p>

<h4>Location and Geography</h4>

<p>The Mut Precinct is located about 100 yards south of the Amun Precinct in the Karnak Temple Complex in modern day Luxor. The Mut Precinct is oriented so that it faces the Amun Precinct (2). The Mut Temple sits on a peninsula on the lake Isheru to its south. This lake was deeply connected to the goddess of Mut and her connection to Egypt and the kingship. The fact that Isheru seems to wrap around the temple has often been seen to reinforce the idea of containing and appeasing the goddesses that make their home there (1).</p>

     <p>The Mut Precinct covers around 90,000 square meters of land and contains at least six temples, as well as the sacred lake in the south end, Isheru (5). Connecting the Mut Precinct to the Amun complex is a long avenue of Sphinxes, likely used during religious parades and processionals (2). The earliest standing remains date back to the New Kingdom under the reigns of Hatshepsut and her co-regent and successor, Thutmosis III, however, it has been suggested that a temple to Mut may have existed on the site since the Middle Kingdom (2). Over the years, hundreds of statues of the goddess Sekhmet were found around the Mut Precinct, most of which were inscribed to Amenhotep III and are believed to have initially come from his mortuary temple on the west side of the Nile (4). It's been estimated that there may have been over 700 of these statues at the precinct at one time - two for each day of the year and were meant to help guarantee that the goddess was kept appeased (2). The structures in the precinct underwent numerous building phases before falling into disuse as a religious center sometime in the 3rd or 2nd century B.C.E. (4). An example of this work was done under the rule of Ramesses II, who place two colossal statues of himself and two alabaster stelae in front of Temple A's first pylon (4). Temple A didn't become part of the actual Mut Precinct until the rule of Taharqa of Dynasty 25, when it became a mammisi, or "birth house" where they celebrated the birth of Mut and Amun's divine children, Khonsu and the pharaoh (2). Also, during Taharqa's rule, Montuemhat, 4th Prophet of Amun, Mayor of Thebes and Governor of Upper Egypt directed work within the Mut Temple. Some of his work included a small chapel to himself within the temple's second court, now known as the Montuemhat Crypt, that described a lot of the work he did, and a small chapel dedicated to his son at the end of the Mut Temple's first pylon (2). These sorts of structures were highly unusual as private individuals weren't usually commemorated in this way, so it speaks to the amount of power that Montuemhat would have had during his lifetime (2).</p>

     <h3>Past Excavations</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>A majority of work done at the Precinct of Mut prior to the mid-1800s consisted of creating plans and records of the site (5). Early explorers at the site included the Napoleon Expedition, Champollion, the Royal Prussian Expedition, Sir John Gardner Wilkinson, Nestor L'Hote, James Burton, and Robert Hays. Many of these expeditions also recovered a number of Sekhmet statues, both complete and fragmentary (6). Some observation and light excavation also took place under Charles Edwin Wilbour, Francois August Mariette, and Urbain Bouriant at separate times (4).</p>

<h4> Benson and Gourlay, Pillet, Chevrier, and Sauneron</h4>

  <p>During three seasons between 1895 to 1897, two British women, Margaret Benson and Janet Gourlay, took on supervising work at the Mut Precinct and performed the first official excavations at the precinct (4). In those three seasons, they cleared debris from the First and Second courts at Mut Temple and the Contra Temple, refined plans drawn up by August Mariette and uncovered numerous high-quality pieces of statuary (4). They also did work to restore and re-erect several of these statues (4). Benson and Gourlay also cleared much debris from the interior of the Mut Temple and investigated the exterior of its south end (5).</p>

  <p>The precinct remained largely unexcavated after Benson and Gourlay's work there until Maurice Pillet, Director of Egyptian Antiquities Organization, came in to excavate and do some restoration work on Temples A and C from 1922 to 1925 (4). Pillet's work uncovered one of two colossal statues of Ramesses II and one of two large alabaster stelae in front of Temple C (2). This stela described Ramesses II's marriage to a Hittite princess (2). In 1950, Pillet's successor, Henri Chevrier, made soundings in the Mut Temple in anticipation work that, for various reasons, did not take place (5). In 1975, with the Institut Francais d'Archeologie Orientale (IFAO), Serge Sauneron cleared and recorded the Mut Temple's Ptolemaic propylon, or first pylon (5). He also translated a religious calendar inscription - this wasn't published until ten years later by Anthony Spalinger (4). Sauneron also completed clearance and recording of the site's main entrance (5).</p>

  <h4>Results and Significance of Past Excavations</h4>

  <p>Much of the early excavation performed was just observation and removal of Sekhmet statues. Benson and Gourlay were the first to begin an official excavation and the precinct and the first women to supervise such a project in Egypt, aided by an Egyptologist and surveyor, performing a more competent excavation than was admitted of two women at the time (5). Most of the work done later at the site between Benson and Gourlay's work and the mid-1970s was more observations and a small amount of restoration projects.</p>

     <h3>Present Excavations</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>A majority of today's excavations and preservation work at the Mut Precinct is conducted by the Brooklyn Museum of Art and Johns Hopkins University, although the two focus in different areas.</p>

  <p>The Brooklyn Expedition at the Precinct of Mut began in 1976, led by Richard Fazzini, now Curator Emeritus of Egyptian Art at the Brooklyn Museum and continues to lead the project today (2). From 1978 to 2001, The Brooklyn Expedition worked closely with the Detroit Institute of Arts doing excavation and restoration work in the norther half of the Mut Precinct (4). The goal of the first five seasons for the Brooklyn Expedition was to record what structures were already visible, determine the plans and histories of the site's main structures, and plan for further excavation and restoration (5). This work included locating and examining records related to previous visitors and missions at the precinct and compile a list of monuments on site (4). In 1979, the Brooklyn Expedition found a second alabaster stela that records Ramesses II's work (most likely on Temple A); this, and the previously found stelae were later removed from the site and placed in Karnak's Open-Air Museum (2). Also in 1979, the team found a large granite head of a ram with a king below his chin at the end of the Mut Temple's first pylon (2). In 1983, the team discovered a gateway that had been included on 19th century maps that was no longer visible on the landscape (2). In 1985, the Brooklyn Expedition discovered the original Hatshepsut/Thutmose III temple platform with outlines of the components of the temple that stood on it chipped into the platform (2). Long-term conservation projects by the Brooklyn Expedition have been conducted on remaining Sekhmet statues at the precinct, including measures of placing the statues on new bases and building up mudbrick walls behind them to help protect them from the elements (2). In the 1990s to 2000s, some of the conservation work also consisted of disassembling various walls and gateway and rebuilding them so that they were more stable (2). Mastabas have also been built to display pieces of temple decoration that couldn't be put back into place (2).</p>

<h4>Johns Hopkins University</h4>

  <p>Excavation work done by Johns Hopkins University at the Mut Precinct is led by Dr. Betsy M. Bryan. Dr. Bryan and the Johns Hopkins team have been working at the precinct since 2001 and have focused their efforts south of the sacred lake of Isheru (4).  In 2001, the team found large amounts of ceramic finds and New Kingdom mudbrick in the area south of the lake, cleared the Thutmose III/Hatshepsut gateway, previously worked on by the Brooklyn Expedition, and performed some work in the Mut Temple proper, including re-erecting, consolidating, and excavating areas around Sekhmet statues still remaining in the temple's First Court and clearing a Late Period gateway located at the west end of the court (4). The 2002 excavation season saw the Johns Hopkins team return to the area south of the lake, where they found a series of storage and industrial installations that dated to the Second Intermediate Period and New Kingdom (4). They also continued work in the Mut Temple, moving to the Second Court and starting excavation in Temple C, where, under the floor in the back sanctuary, they found a statue fo Ramesses III (4). In 2003, the team focused more in the area south of the lake and discovered a New Kingdom mudbrick and plaster inner enclosure wall, located about five meters north of where a larger, outer enclosure wall was previously found (4). They also found baking and brewing installations of Second Intermediate Period and 18th Dynasty date (4). In 2006, the team uncovered a life-sized statue of a queen (3). In the excavation season of 2011, the team located human remains buried to the south of the sacred lake (3). In the following season of 2012, more remains were found in the same area and it has since been dubbed a potential cemetery (3).</p>

  <p>Throughout the years of excavation in the area south of the lake, the Johns Hopkins team found several fragments of nude female figurines made of baked clay in what were identified as refuse zones (4). Upon closer inspection, the patterns of breakage on these fragments strongly suggested that the figures were deliberately broken before they were disposed (4). More specifically, these fragments showed a clear lateral break at the female's torso-hip region, which is often the thickest and sturdiest part of the figurine (4). This indicated that such breakage was done purposefully, and the figurines were perhaps used as part of some religious ritual (4).</p>

  <h4> Results and Significance of Present Excavation</h4>

  <p>The most recent excavations so far, have revealed that the precinct underwent several stages of construction and modification during its long use as a religious center and even functioned on its own with breweries and granaries directly within precinct walls. Recent missions here have also worked largely to understand the history of early excavations and the complete layout of the precinct, as well as to restore and preserve pieces that still remain on site. Much remains to be learned about the precinct as the teams from Johns Hopkins University and the Brooklyn Museum continue to excavate and reveal the site's secrets.</p>

 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The Mut Precinct fits into overall Egyptian archaeology in that it lies within the larger Karnak Temple Complex, where it was home to the goddess Mut, part of the Theban Triad, and was literally connected to the Amun Complex by a road flanked by sphinxes. The precinct is also connected to the kingship, as the goddess Sekhmet was a protector of the kingship and Mut was the mother of divine children - both Khonsu and the pharaoh. This connection would have helped to legitimize the rule of pharaohs, by placing the pharaoh and seat of power in the same city as the gods who gave life to divine children.</p>
